IMPLEMENTATION 
OF A NEURAL

Voluntary arm movements 
have been 
recently approached 
in a previous study by assuming 
that a single 
feedback 
system 
can account for the entire reaching 
movement: 
a controller is hypothesized 
to drive a double 
joint mechanical 
structure, 
representing 
the human 
arm. In this paper, 
a neural network implementation 
of the 
above 
controller is presented 
and 
discussed. 
Two subjects 
have 
been 
tested: 
they were 
required 
either 
to reach 
and 
grasp, 
or to point to three-dimensional 
objects 
placed 
on a 
table. 
Arm movements 
were studied 
and 
recorded 
in 8 
different experimental 
conditions, in which the following parameters 
varied: object distance, 
stimulus size 
and 
distal task. 
Some 
analogies 
were 
found between 
parameters 
of nets 
trained 
by motor task 
being 
different only for 
movement 
amplitude 
or in the stimulus size. 
These 
analogies 
were 
evaluated 
by checking 
the euclidean 
distance 
between 
the following parameters: 
1) 
Distance 
between 
sinaptic 
weights 
arrays; 
2) Distance 
between 
bias 
arrays; 
3) Distance 
between 
tbe hidden 
units values 
arrays. 
A structure 
analogy 
(i.e. the 
case 
when 
analogy 
holds 
for the 
entire set of considered 
parameters) 
has been 
found between 
motor tasks 
differing only in amplitude. These 
results 
were 
verified by using 
a trained 
net 
working in forward mode, 
and 
feeding 
it with trajectories 
belonging 
to 
another 
motor task, different from the learned 
ones. 
The net was found to satisfactorily reproduce 
the output 
trajectories 
only when 
the input trajectories 
belonged 
to a 
motor task 
differing in amplitude 
from the one 
used 
for 
training the net. No analogy 
could be found between 
nets 
trained with the same 
motor tasks, 
but performed 
by 
different subjects. 
The above 
reported 
analogies 
mainly agree 
with kinematic analysis. 
Finally, nets 
trained 
with 
data 
coming from grasping 
tasks 
were 
found to have 
hidden 
neural 
elements 
more 
excited 
than 
those 
trained 
with 
pointing data, 
reasonably 
meaning 
a stronger 
control action 
in the grasping 
tasks.

One particular aspect 
of biomechanics 
concerns 
the movements 
of the eyes. 
In the oculomotor system 
(responsible 
of all eyes’ movements), 
certain 
premotor 
neurons 
fire at a 
rate 
proportional 
to desired 
eye 
velocity. 
Their output 
is integrated 
by a network of neurons 
to supply 
an 
eye 
position command 
to the 
motoneurons 
of the 
extraocular 
muscles. 
We develop 
a biologically plausible 
self-organizing 
neural network that can simulate this 
system, 
known as 
the neural integrator. This network intensively uses 
recurrent 
connections 
in its hidden 
layer. 
It learns 
by using a general 
supervisor 
that continuously 
minimizes 
several 
error-functions 
using the Levenberg- 
Marquardt 
algorithm and 
corrects 
all the weights. 
This general 
supervisor 
collects 
data 
in a temporal 
processing 
window which allows it to calculate 
the correct 
error-functions. 
The quality of the chosen 
method is due to the 
fact that it can ultimately achieve 
a quadratic 
rate of convergence, 
despite 
the fact that only first-order deriva- 
tives 
are used 
to compute 
a search 
direction 
p. We also 
prove that the network can easily recover from various 
lesions 
such 
as 
an hemilabyrintbectomy 
or the 
removal 
of one 
interneuron. 
Moreover, 
we prove that our network 
can 
perform signal processing 
more 
complicated 
than 
just integration. 
The field of application 
are 
wide and 
large 
and 
certainly not restricted 
to the simulation of the oculomotor 
system 
and 
the 
biomechanics 
aspects 
of vision.

Movements 
in the 
ankle 
joint complex 
were analysed 
with help of a three 
dimensional 
model, 
in which the 
talocrural 
and 
subtalar 
joints were 
represented 
by ideal 
hinges. 
An optimization 
method 
was 
developed 
to determine 
the 
position and 
orientation 
of the 
joint axes 
by fitting the 
model 
parameters 
to measured 
relative movements 
between 
foot and 
shank. 
The method 
was 
applied 
to 14 
male 
subjects, 
performing non-weightbearing 
movements 
through 
the entire 
ranges 
of motion of the two joints. Kinematic data 
were 
collected 
from three 
markers 
on the foot 
and 
three 
markers 
on the shank, 
at 200 Hz during 8 trials of 4 seconds 
each. 
Reliability of the optimization method 
was 
determined 
by error propagation 
analysis 
and 
by repeated 
tests 
on one 
subject. 
The average 
inclination of the subtalar 
joint axis 
was 
37.4k2.7’ (repeatability 
0.4’), and 
the 
medial deviation of 
the 
axis was 18.O~b16.2~ 
(repeatability 
5.0°).The talocrumljoint axis 
was approximately mcdlolatersl, with an 
inclination of 7.ti.4” 
(repeatability 1.0”) and 
a posterior 
deviation of 6.8f8.1’ (repeatability 
2.8’). The subtalar 
joint inclination was significantly correlated to the arch heightoftbefoot(r2 
=0.75) 
and a“tarssl lndex"determined 
by radiographic 
analysis 
(r*=O.40). The results 
of this group agree 
well with previous 
in vitro studies. 
The 
optimization method is sufficiently accurate to determine subject-specificmodelpsrsmeters 
for use ofthetwo-axis 
joint model for biomcchsnicalanalysis 
of movements and forces in the ankle joint complexduringgait.

treats 
kinematic 
and dynamic 
modeling 
of a three-dimensional 
five

model 
of humain 
walking 
standing 
on one leg.For 
this 
study, 
we have considered 
each of the model's 
link 
as a rigid 
body with 
three 
rotational 
degrees 
of 
freedom. 
We 
used the Euler-angles 
of this 
body, 
the 
inertial 
coordinate 
of his 
center 
of mass, 
the 
holonomic 
constraints 
and the 
nonholonomic 
constraints. 
To derive 
a well 
structured 
set 
of equations 
of motion 
, we have employed 
the Newton-Euler 
formulation 
in which 
we have eliminated 
all 
constraint 
forces 
by a mathematical 
process. 
This 
elimination 
results 
in a reduced 
state 
space system. 
The approach 
is a general 
one and can be 
utilized 
when both 
feet 
are 
on the 
ground; 
i.e., 
when closed 
chains 
exist.

Voluntary arm movements 
have been 
recently approached 
in a previous study by assuming 
that a single

can account for the entire reaching

a controller is hypothesized 
to drive a double

a neural network implementation 
of the 
above

Two subjects 
have 
been 
tested: 
they were 
required 
either 
to reach

or to point to three-dimensional 
objects 
placed 
on a

Arm movements 
were studied 
and 
recorded 
in 8 
different experimental

varied: object distance, 
stimulus size 
and

Some 
analogies 
were 
found between 
parameters 
of nets 
trained 
by motor task 
being 
different only for

or in the stimulus size. 
These

were 
evaluated 
by checking 
the euclidean

between 
the following parameters: 
1) 
Distance

(i.e. the

only when 
the input trajectories

could be found between 
nets 
trained with the same

but performed 
by 
different subjects. 
The above 
reported 
analogies 
mainly agree 
with kinematic analysis. 
Finally, nets

found to have

Voluntary arm movements 
have been 
recently approached 
in a previous study by assuming 
that a single 
feedback 
system 
can account for the entire reaching 
movement: 
a controller is hypothesized 
to drive a double 
joint mechanical 
structure, 
representing 
the human 
arm. In this paper, 
a neural network implementation 
of the 
above 
controller is presented 
and 
discussed. 
Two subjects 
have 
been 
tested: 
they were 
required 
either 
to reach 
and 
grasp, 
or to point to three-dimensional 
objects 
placed 
on a 
table. 
Arm movements 
were studied 
and 
recorded 
in 8 
different experimental 
conditions, in which the following parameters 
varied: object distance, 
stimulus size 
and 
distal task. 
Some 
analogies 
were 
found between 
parameters 
of nets 
trained 
by motor task 
being 
different only for 
movement 
amplitude 
or in the stimulus size. 
These 
analogies 
were 
evaluated 
by checking 
the euclidean 
distance 
between 
the following parameters: 
1) 
Distance 
between 
sinaptic 
weights 
arrays; 
2) Distance 
between 
bias 
arrays; 
3) Distance 
between 
tbe hidden 
units values 
arrays. 
A structure 
analogy 
(i.e. the 
case 
when 
analogy 
holds 
for the 
entire set of considered 
parameters) 
has been 
found between 
motor tasks 
differing only in amplitude. These 
results 
were 
verified by using 
a trained 
net 
working in forward mode, 
and 
feeding 
it with trajectories 
belonging 
to 
another 
motor task, different from the learned 
ones. 
The net was found to satisfactorily reproduce 
the output 
trajectories 
only when 
the input trajectories 
belonged 
to a 
motor task 
differing in amplitude 
from the one 
used 
for 
training the net. No analogy 
could be found between 
nets 
trained with the same 
motor tasks, 
but performed 
by 
different subjects. 
The above 
reported 
analogies 
mainly agree 
with kinematic analysis. 
Finally, nets 
trained 
with 
data 
coming from grasping 
tasks 
were 
found to have 
hidden 
neural 
elements 
more 
excited 
than 
those 
trained 
with 
pointing data, 
reasonably 
meaning 
a stronger 
control action 
in the grasping 
tasks.

One particular aspect 
of biomechanics 
concerns 
the movements 
of the eyes. 
In the oculomotor system 
(responsible 
of all eyes’ movements), 
certain 
premotor 
neurons 
fire at a 
rate 
proportional 
to desired 
eye 
velocity. 
Their output 
is integrated 
by a network of neurons 
to supply 
an 
eye 
position command 
to the 
motoneurons 
of the 
extraocular 
muscles. 
We develop 
a biologically plausible 
self-organizing 
neural network that can simulate this 
system, 
known as 
the neural integrator. This network intensively uses 
recurrent 
connections 
in its hidden 
layer. 
It learns 
by using a general 
supervisor 
that continuously 
minimizes 
several 
error-functions 
using the Levenberg- 
Marquardt 
algorithm and 
corrects 
all the weights. 
This general 
supervisor 
collects 
data 
in a temporal 
processing 
window which allows it to calculate 
the correct 
error-functions. 
The quality of the chosen 
method is due to the 
fact that it can ultimately achieve 
a quadratic 
rate of convergence, 
despite 
the fact that only first-order deriva- 
tives 
are used 
to compute 
a search 
direction 
p. We also 
prove that the network can easily recover from various 
lesions 
such 
as 
an hemilabyrintbectomy 
or the 
removal 
of one 
interneuron. 
Moreover, 
we prove that our network 
can 
perform signal processing 
more 
complicated 
than 
just integration. 
The field of application 
are 
wide and 
large 
and 
certainly not restricted 
to the simulation of the oculomotor 
system 
and 
the 
biomechanics 
aspects 
of vision.

using

linear

Thereby 
the greater

is exposed 
to compression 
only 
instead

EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL WEIGHT ON MUSCULAR POWER AND PERFORMANCE IN VERTICAL 
JUMP MOTION 
Norihisa FUJII* and Toshimichi MORIWAKI’* 
*Graduate School of Science and Technology, **Faculty of Engineering 
KOBE University, JAPAN 
The relations between the anthropometric characteristics of human body and the vertical jump 
motion were investigated from the viewpoints of muscular power and performance. The vertical jump 
motions of four male subjects were analyzed under the four conditions, in which an additional weight 
was attached to the subject at the shoulder, waist, or ankle in order to vary the anthropometric 
characteristics of the subjects intentionally. Simulations were also carried out based on the 
musculoskeletal model, in which the parameters of body segments were selected according to the 
experimental conditions. It was shown that the power generation of the mono-joint muscle under the 
condition with the additional weight at the ankle was less than those of other conditions. It was also 
shown that the jump height with the additional weight at ankle was less than those of other conditions. 
It was suggested that the cause of the differences of the jump height was that the two-joint muscles 
could not control the power generation of mono-joint muscles enough for the reason of transferring the 
large power to shank segment at which the additional weight was attached. It was also suggested that 
not only the muscular power but also the mass distribution of human body were important to improve 
the jump height in the vertical jump motion. 
AN OPTIMAL CONTROL MODEL FOR RISING FROM A CHAIR

To understand 
how muscles 
coordinate 
motion of the 
body segments 
as 
humans 
stand 
up from a seated 
position, 
we developed 
a detailed 
optimal control model 
for rising from a chair. We modeled 
the human 
body 
as a three-segment, 
articulated, planar linkage actuated 
by eight lower-extremity musculotendinous 
units. 
Because 
the performance 
criterion for rising from a chair is ambiguous, 
we evaluated 
several 
measures 
of 
performance. Minimizing a quantity which depends 
upon 
muscle 
force alone 
(e.g., 
normalized 
muscle 
force 
squared, 
STRESS) 
produces 
a ballistic movement 
characterized 
by a rapid upward 
acceleration 
of the model’s 
center 
of mass 
near 
seat 
lift-off. In contrast, 
minimizing a quantity which depends 
upon 
the time derivative of 
normalized 
muscle force (FDOT) produces 
a more gradual acceleration 
of the model’s 
center of mass 
since 
muscle 
force changes 
less 
rapidly with time. However, 
minimizing FDOT alone 
does 
not produce 
a response 
of the 
model 
which replicates 
the 
way humans 
stand 
up from a seated 
position 
as 
muscles 
are 
recruited 
from the 
very beginning of the movement. Therefore, we formulated a constraint-based 
performance criterion to 
simulate 
rising from a chair (STRESSFDOT) 
in which STRESS 
WBS 
minimized prior to seat 
lift-off and 
FDOT 
was 
minimized after seat 
lift-off. In agreement 
with experiment, 
most muscles 
in the model remained 
silent 
until just prior to seat 
lift-off, after which they were recruited gradually and continuously until the model 
reached 
standing. Furthermore, 
the 
peak 
vertical ground 
force generated 
by the model 
was 
in close 
agreement 
with that obtained 
experimentally. We are 
planning to use 
this model to study 
the effects of muscle 
strength, 
seat 
height, 
and 
foot position on performance

EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL WEIGHT ON MUSCULAR POWER AND PERFORMANCE IN VERTICAL 
JUMP MOTION 
Norihisa FUJII* and Toshimichi MORIWAKI’* 
*Graduate School of Science and Technology, **Faculty of Engineering 
KOBE University, JAPAN 
The relations between the anthropometric characteristics of human body and the vertical jump 
motion were investigated from the viewpoints of muscular power and performance. The vertical jump 
motions of four male subjects were analyzed under the four conditions, in which an additional weight 
was attached to the subject at the shoulder, waist, or ankle in order to vary the anthropometric 
characteristics of the subjects intentionally. Simulations were also carried out based on the 
musculoskeletal model, in which the parameters of body segments were selected according to the 
experimental conditions. It was shown that the power generation of the mono-joint muscle under the 
condition with the additional weight at the ankle was less than those of other conditions. It was also 
shown that the jump height with the additional weight at ankle was less than those of other conditions. 
It was suggested that the cause of the differences of the jump height was that the two-joint muscles 
could not control the power generation of mono-joint muscles enough for the reason of transferring the 
large power to shank segment at which the additional weight was attached. It was also suggested that 
not only the muscular power but also the mass distribution of human body were important to improve 
the jump height in the vertical jump motion. 
AN OPTIMAL CONTROL MODEL FOR RISING FROM A CHAIR

To understand 
how muscles 
coordinate 
motion of the 
body segments 
as 
humans 
stand 
up from a seated 
position, 
we developed 
a detailed 
optimal control model 
for rising from a chair. We modeled 
the human 
body 
as a three-segment, 
articulated, planar linkage actuated 
by eight lower-extremity musculotendinous 
units. 
Because 
the performance 
criterion for rising from a chair is ambiguous, 
we evaluated 
several 
measures 
of 
performance. Minimizing a quantity which depends 
upon 
muscle 
force alone 
(e.g., 
normalized 
muscle 
force 
squared, 
STRESS) 
produces 
a ballistic movement 
characterized 
by a rapid upward 
acceleration 
of the model’s 
center 
of mass 
near 
seat 
lift-off. In contrast, 
minimizing a quantity which depends 
upon 
the time derivative of 
normalized 
muscle force (FDOT) produces 
a more gradual acceleration 
of the model’s 
center of mass 
since 
muscle 
force changes 
less 
rapidly with time. However, 
minimizing FDOT alone 
does 
not produce 
a response 
of the 
model 
which replicates 
the 
way humans 
stand 
up from a seated 
position 
as 
muscles 
are 
recruited 
from the 
very beginning of the movement. Therefore, we formulated a constraint-based 
performance criterion to 
simulate 
rising from a chair (STRESSFDOT) 
in which STRESS 
WBS 
minimized prior to seat 
lift-off and 
FDOT 
was 
minimized after seat 
lift-off. In agreement 
with experiment, 
most muscles 
in the model remained 
silent 
until just prior to seat 
lift-off, after which they were recruited gradually and continuously until the model 
reached 
standing. Furthermore, 
the 
peak 
vertical ground 
force generated 
by the model 
was 
in close 
agreement 
with that obtained 
experimentally. We are 
planning to use 
this model to study 
the effects of muscle 
strength, 
seat 
height, 
and 
foot position on performance 
biomechanics 
of rising from a chair.

MODELWNG THE VERTICAL GROUND REACTION FORCE 
DURING GAIT AS A COMBINATION 
OF SPRINGS 
AND DAMPERS. 
L.A.Gilchrist and 
D.A.Winter 
University of Waterloo, 
Waterloo, 
Canada 
A combination 
of springs 
and 
dampers 
were 
used 
to model 
the vertical 
component 
of the 
ground 
reaction 
force (GRF) in a simulation 
of foot motion during normal 
human 
walking. The foot was 
modelled 
as 
an 
unconstrained 
(6 DOF), rigid element; 
no other 
segments 
were 
included 
in the simulation. The driving forces 
were: I. the resultant 
forces 
and 
moments 
at the ankle, 
2. the horizontal 
components 
of the 
GRF, 
and 
3. the 
moment 
due 
to the 
vertical component 
of the 
GRF. These 
forces 
were 
all found using 
standard 
inverse 
solution, 
gait analysis 
techniques. 
For 
the 
simulation 
a combination 
of 3 spring/damper 
pairs 
applied 
at the 
centre 
of mass 
(CM) of the 
foot was 
found 
to yield acceptable 
predictions 
of the 
vertical displacement 
of the 
CM of the 
foot. The first spring 
to come 
into play was 
linear (k = 10739 
N/m) and 
relatively long (9.7 cm). 
The second 
spring 
was 
also 
linear, but stiffer (k = 90000 
N/m) and 
shotir (5.7 cm). The third spring 
was 
non-linear 
and 
depended 
on the vertical displacement 
of the 
toe 
(F = 600*x*). The dampen 
were 
all non- 
linear 
until a given 
compression 
was 
reached 
and 
were 
linear 
thereafter. 
This model 
allowed 
for the 
impact 
that occurs 
at heel 
contact, 
and 
successfully 
predicted 
the vertical 
GRF throughout 
stance. 
The model 
was 
then 
applied 
to the 
data 
from another 
walking hial by the 
same 
subject 
and 
to that 
from a trial by a different 
subject. In both 
cases. 
the 
predicted 
vertical 
foot displacement 
matched 
the 
measured 
vettical displacement 
quite closely. This work represents 
the 
first step 
in developing 
a complete 
foot model 
which can 
be 
applied 
to a broad 
range 
of normal 
walking patterns.

It is of interest to know whether purely objective analysis 
of gait data 
can he sensitive 
to alteration of 
pattern without resort to subjective impressions. 
Artificial neural networks are a multivariate method often 
based 
on a biological model. A three layered feed-forward back-propagation 
neural network, as well as a 
statistical 
method (Linear Discriminant Analysis), was applied to a gait pattern recognition problem. The 
temporal parameters 
from artificially altered gait patterns 
were collected and it was of interest to know if 
neural networks are more sensitive 
to differences 
of data 
than conventional 
statistics. Six models were studied 
in which the speed 
of walking was related to three temporal parameters 
(double support phase, 
right and left 
single support phase). Data from ten subjects 
were used 
to train the network of each studied 
model and a data 
set from ten further subjects 
was used 
to test it. The overall performance 
of the network is at least as high as 
that of statistics 
and the encouraging 
results suggest 
that a network is a useful method in the recognition of 
human 
patterns 
of movement 
and may applied to problems where statistics 
cannot.

THE USE OF NEURAL NETWORKS TO RECOGNISE PATTERNS OF HUMAN GAIT UNDER 
NORMAL AND ABNORMAL CONDITIONS: A PRELIMINARY STUDY

It is of interest to know whether purely objective analysis 
of gait data 
can he sensitive 
to alteration of 
pattern without resort to subjective impressions. 
Artificial neural networks are a multivariate method often 
based 
on a biological model. A three layered feed-forward back-propagation 
neural network, as well as a 
statistical 
method (Linear Discriminant Analysis), was applied to a gait pattern recognition problem. The 
temporal parameters 
from artificially altered gait patterns 
were collected and it was of interest to know if 
neural networks are more sensitive 
to differences 
of data 
than conventional 
statistics. Six models were studied 
in which the speed 
of walking was related to three temporal parameters 
(double support phase, 
right and left 
single support phase). Data from ten subjects 
were used 
to train the network of each studied 
model and a data 
set from ten further subjects 
was used 
to test it. The overall performance 
of the network is at least as high as 
that of statistics 
and the encouraging 
results suggest 
that a network is a useful method in the recognition of 
human 
patterns 
of movement 
and may applied to problems where statistics 
cannot.

COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT OPTIMIZATION APPROACHES 
FOR THE EVALUATION OF 
INTERNAL MADS OF THE LOWER LIMB 
Ulrich Glitsch 
Institute of Biomechanics, 
Cologne, Germany. 
A 4-segments 
model of the lower limb (hip, thigh, shank 
and foot) containing 47 muscles 
was de- 
veloped 
in order to calculate 
the internal loads 
during walking and running. The inverse 
dynamics 
problem 
was solved 
by optimization methods 
using linear and nonlinear objective functions. EMG patterns from 8 
muscles 
served 
as 
qualitative evaluation 
of the results. 
The model 
pointed 
out that linear optimization is in- 
appropriate 
in this case 
because 
it considerably 
underestimates 
the number of activated muscles. On the 
other hand, the predicted muscle forces and muscle tensions respectively are overestimated. The 
minimization of the quadradic muscle forces resulted 
in a better agreement with the EMG patterns, but 
calculated 
also very high muscle tensions for some muscles 
with 2 MPa for walking and 3.9 MPa for 
running respectively. Quadratic muscle stress minimization yielded the best agreement 
with the EMG 
patterns 
and the maximum muscle stress 
was reduced 
by 40-5096. 
The incorporation of the HILL muscle 
model 
was not satisfying because 
of its very limited relevance 
for submaximal 
muscle 
contractions 
and the 
absence 
of reliable model parameters. 
A main task is the appropriate 
modelling of the dynamics of the 
knee 
joint and the ankle joint. Revolute 
joints lead to unrealistic high torsional loads, whereas 
spherical 
joints lead to astronomical muscle forces. A dynamical flexible joint construction achieved 
by a penalty 
function delivers moderate 
torsional 
joint loads 
and moderate 
muscle 
stresses. 
APPLICATIONS OF A MULTI-BODY SIMULATION MODEL IN HUMAN MOVEMENT STUDIES

In this study the DADS (Dynamic Analysis and Design System) software package was used in 
order to create 
a 3-dimensional 15 segments 
model of the human 
body. Until now, there have been two 
applications 
of the simulation model. The first one dealt with a gymnast’s 
problem on the still rings where 
sometimes 
the whole system starts swinging caused 
by certain maneuvers. As prototype served the 
dislocate 
performed by a gymnast 
which resulted 
in a forward and backward 
swinging of the whole system 
of +-23.5 cm. The simulation of the dislocate showed that the muscular action of the gymnast had 
increased 
the total amount of energy of 23 J at the linaI position which was the same 
as at the beginning. 
Starting 
a second 
dislocate 
at the beginning 
of the forward swinging reduced 
the oscillation to +-5 cm. In 
the second 
example, the model was settled 
up for simulation of airborne movements 
in a gravitational field 
in order to get some practical hints for the improvement of the twisting skills in combination with 
sommersauhs 
in trampolining. The simulation demonstrated 
the possibility of performing all maneuvers 
with straightened 
arms and keeping them close to the trunk during twits as required in the judgement 
directions.

A GENETIC ALOGORITHM FOR OPTIMAL MOTOR SIGNAL PROCESSING : COMPARISON WITH 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. 
S. Hanneton. Laboratoire de Physiologie de la Perception et de 1’Action. 
15, rue de I’Ecole de Medecine, Paris (France). 
The nervous system controls limb movement by regulating muscle contractions according to 
laws which are not well understood. In this theoritical study, applied to a simple but realistic joint 
model, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal motor command for a rapid 
orienting movement. The joint model used was composed of an inverted pendulum, to which were fixed 
two formal elastic muscles. The two motor signals, discretized in time, were then modeled to represent 
the chromosomes of an imaginary individual with a level of adaptation corresponding to the inverse of 
the trajectory error that would be produced by the command. The simulated evolution of an initial 
population revealed that a unique optimal solution seems to exist. It is remarkable that the computed 
motor command showed the triphasic pattern almost always observed in E.M.G recording of fast 
orienting movements. The results obtained here show that the utilisation of a criterion function as 
simple as that of minimizing the angular error provides an optimal solution that is comparable to 
experimental observations. 
OBJECT-ORIENTED APPROACH TO MUSCULOSKELETAL MODELLING 
K. Hansson, H. Lanshammar and T. Sahl6n 
Systems and Control Group, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden 
An object-oriented approach is a very general way to treat a problem. A system is divided 
into small cooperative parts, called objects. 
By using this approach in biomechanics the exchange of models becomes a lot easier. 
Object-oriented design also results in reusable software systems, which are more flexible to 
changes than traditional ones. 
There are four main concepts assoclared with object-oriented modelling: abstracrion, 
encapsulation, modularity and hierarchy. To illustrate the benefits of object-oriented modelling we 
have modelled the human body as an object-oriented system. 
The body parts are represented by objects. These objects are hierarchically sorted, which 
implies that larger parts contain smaller ones. For instance a leg can contain segments and joints. 
By using encapsulation in our model a user just tells a segment or a leg to move without 
having to worry about how the motion is realized, since that is encapsulated. 
Our model consists of a number of replaceable modules. If we are using a 2D model and 
switch to a 3D model, this change will not affect the cooperation between the body parts. 
With the aid of abstraction the model is focused on the essential characteristics of the human 
body, relative to the perspective of the viewer. 
INVERSE DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION OF SHOULDER MUSCLE ACTIVITY 
DURING FAST, GOAL DIRECTED ARM MOVEMENTS 
Riender Happce and Frans C.T. van der Helm 
Man-Machine Systems Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands. 
A detailed musculoskeletal 
model of the shoulder 
mechanism 
has 
been 
developed 
in which all relevant gross 
morphological 
structures 
are. 
represented. 
Muscles in the shoulder 
have 
been 
modelled with 95 muscle lines of action. In an inverse 
dynamic 
optimization procedure 
of goal directed arm movements, 
muscle forces have been calculated taking into account the effect 
of muscle dynamics. To avoid the time-consuming re-iteration of the complete motion, a new approach 
has been used. At 
each time-instant muscle forces are bounded to a maximal and minimal force due to the time history of muscle activation. 
Using these 
boundaries 
the load-sharing 
problem is solved. 
The corresponding 
neural input to the muscles 
is calculated 
using 
an inverse muscle model. This procedure is repeated 
for the next time-step, etcetera. 
EMG and muscle activation showed 
a good temporal agreement. 
A cle,ar 
tri-phasic activation pattern was found for the prime movers of the glenohumeral 
joint. 
Thoracoscapular muscles and rotator cuff muscles showed some differing patterns due to their additional activity for 
stabilizing the scapula on the thorax, and preventing dislocation of the glenohumeral 
joint, respectively. Thoracoscapular 
muscles contributed about 40% of the mechanical work during anteflexion, and about 22% during retroflexion. In these 
simulations it is the first time that the complex mechanics of the shoulder mechanism and the dynamics of the muscles 
controlling the shoulder motions have been combined. It is concluded that the simulations provided comprehensive 
information on the function of shoulder muscles in a dynamic setting.

Muscles in the shoulder 
have 
been 
modelled with 95 muscle lines of action. In an inverse 
dynamic 
optimization procedure 
of goal directed arm movements, 
muscle forces have been calculated taking into account the effect 
of muscle dynamics. To avoid the time-consuming re-iteration of the complete motion, a new approach 
has been used. At 
each time-instant muscle forces are bounded to a maximal and minimal force due to the time history of muscle activation. 
Using these 
boundaries 
the load-sharing 
problem is solved. 
The corresponding 
neural input to the muscles 
is calculated 
using 
an inverse muscle model. This procedure is repeated

EMG and muscle activation showed 
a good temporal agreement. 
A cle,ar 
tri-phasic activation pattern was found for the prime movers of the glenohumeral 
joint. 
Thoracoscapular muscles and rotator cuff muscles showed some differing patterns due to their additional activity for 
stabilizing the scapula on the thorax, and preventing dislocation of the glenohumeral 
joint, respectively. Thoracoscapular 
muscles contributed about 40% of the mechanical work during anteflexion, and about 22% during retroflexion. In these 
simulations it is the first time that the complex mechanics of the shoulder mechanism and the dynamics of the muscles 
controlling the shoulder motions have been combined. It is concluded that the simulations provided comprehensive 
information on the function of shoulder muscles in a dynamic setting.

A GENETIC ALOGORITHM FOR OPTIMAL MOTOR SIGNAL PROCESSING : COMPARISON WITH 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. 
S. Hanneton. Laboratoire de Physiologie de la Perception et de 1’Action. 
15, rue de I’Ecole de Medecine, Paris (France). 
The nervous system controls limb movement by regulating muscle contractions according to 
laws which are not well understood. In this theoritical study, applied to a simple but realistic joint 
model, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal motor command for a rapid 
orienting movement. The joint model used was composed of an inverted pendulum, to which were fixed 
two formal elastic muscles. The two motor signals, discretized in time, were then modeled to represent 
the chromosomes of an imaginary individual with a level of adaptation corresponding to the inverse of 
the trajectory error that would be produced by the command. The simulated evolution of an initial 
population revealed that a unique optimal solution seems to exist. It is remarkable that the computed 
motor command showed the triphasic pattern almost always observed in E.M.G recording of fast 
orienting movements. The results obtained here show that the utilisation of a criterion function as 
simple as that of minimizing the angular error provides an optimal solution that is comparable to 
experimental observations. 
OBJECT-ORIENTED APPROACH TO MUSCULOSKELETAL MODELLING 
K. Hansson, H. Lanshammar and T. Sahl6n 
Systems and Control Group, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden 
An object-oriented approach is a very general way to treat a problem. A system is divided 
into small cooperative parts, called objects. 
By using this approach in biomechanics the exchange of models becomes a lot easier. 
Object-oriented design also results in reusable software systems, which are more flexible to 
changes than traditional ones. 
There are four main concepts assoclared with object-oriented modelling: abstracrion, 
encapsulation, modularity and hierarchy. To illustrate the benefits of object-oriented modelling we 
have modelled the human body as an object-oriented system. 
The body parts are represented by objects. These objects are hierarchically sorted, which 
implies that larger parts contain smaller ones. For instance a leg can contain segments and joints. 
By using encapsulation in our model a user just tells a segment or a leg to move without 
having to worry about how the motion is realized, since that is encapsulated. 
Our model consists of a number of replaceable modules. If we are using a 2D model and 
switch to a 3D model, this change will not affect the cooperation between the body parts. 
With the aid of abstraction the model is focused on the essential characteristics of the human 
body, relative to the perspective of the viewer.

the 
gap at the left hip joint for a full stride had a mean global value of (-0.07, .54, 0.21 cm). The first stel’ 
removed any bias in the gap by correcting the original estimate of hip joint centre by (.04, -0.54, -0.21 cm)

As an example for a planar multibody system a skier is modeled by four segments: shanks, 
thighs, upper body, and feet-boots-skis. To describe the state of a segment generalized Cartesian 
coordinates are used: the position of the centre of mass and the orientation. Thus, the state of the 
system 
is described by a vector y of 12 dependent coordinates. The segments 
are connected by three 
joints: ankle, knee, and hip,, 
which lends to 6 algebraic copqtraints 
between these coordinates. By video 
analysis 
the orientations and the coordinates of a foot point were determined as functions of time. This 
gives 6 driving constraints. The equations of motion are a system of differential algebraic equations 
(DAEs) of index 3: M(y,t) j; = f,(y,y,t) + f,, g(y,t) = 0. The mass matrix M is a diagonal matrix, f. 
denotes the applied forces, and f, the constraint forces. By differentiating the constraint equations g = 
0 one obtains DAJZs 
of index 2 which can be solved by recently developed numerical methods, e.g. the 
code MEXX of Lubich. This code requires M, f., g, and the derivatives of g with respect to y and t (g,, 
g,) as input and computes y, y, ji and the constraint forces f, This is an easy 
and clear way to formulate 
the equations of motion. The large number of dependent variables is an obvious disadvantage. It is 
compensated 
since (1) the mass 
matrix is in 2D diagonal, (2) the generalized gyroscopic forces do not 
occur in the DAEs, and (3) & is sparse. 
The code works reliable. The results are reasonable.

CHANGES OF THE SHOULDER MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERN WHEN INCREASING THE 
STIFFNESS OF THE ARM 
Dan Karlsson 
Department of Biomechanics and Orthopaedic Technology, 
University College of Health Sciences, Box 1038, S-551 11 JLinkeping, SWEDEN 
Different muscle force distributions cause different stability or stiffness of a joint in the musculo- 
skeletal system. In this study different force distributions among the shoulder muscles are examined. 
The chosen position is a static arm posture of loo of abduction and 30“ internal rotation of the 
humerus. The elbow is flexed 90’. Theoretical analysis of this position is performed by using a 3-D 
computer model of the shoulder where a force distribution is derived by minimising an objective 
function. The different distributions are simulated by manipulating the lower limits of the muscle force 
constrains. In this way an increased cocontraction can be reproduced. For each chosen distribution 
case the stiffness matrix of the entire shoulder joint may be calculated along with the corresponding 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It is shown that the chosen position has a lowest stiffness in a direction 
almost perpendicular to the plane of the humerus and the ulna. Increasing the force in the posterior 
deltoid muscle gives the most effective increase of the least stiff direction. Accordingly, other muscle 
activities are increased as well. 
KINEMATIC 
SINGULARITIES 
IN HUMAN ARM MOTION 
J. Kieffer, J. LenarEiE 
The objective is to study the human arm motion in terms of attainable velocities and 
their relationship with the joint torques and forces applied to the arm. The method is 
based on the manipulability ellipses and singularity theory. A number of examples 
considering how humans use singularities is studied in detail using a 2R planar 
kinematic model of the arm in the first stage and the 6R spatial mechanism in the 
second stage. It is observed by computer simulations that humans take advantages of 
singularity configurations to minimise efforts and reduce fatugue while handling 
weights. The disadvantage is the complexity of velocity limits which make difficult to 
plan the timing of motion. On the other hand, the self-motion of the human arm can 
serve to change the velocity-force properties in almost every point of the workspace. 
A NUMERICAL 
TECHNIQUE TO PREDICT THE WALKING MOVEMENT AT DIFFERENT VELOCITIES 
H.F.J.M. Koopman and H.J. Grootenboer 
Institute of Biomedical Enginexxing, University of Twente, Ens&de, The Netherlands 
A predictive model of walking may be useful in the clinicxd practise to estimate the effect of different conditions on 
pathological walking. Such a numerical model is developed and appkd to predict the normal waking movement at different

optimization parameters are the points in time of heel-contact and toe-off and the Fourier coefficients describing the

CHANGES OF THE SHOULDER MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERN WHEN INCREASING THE 
STIFFNESS OF THE ARM

University College of Health Sciences, Box 1038, S-551 11 JLinkeping, SWEDEN 
Different muscle force distributions cause different stability or stiffness of a joint in the musculo- 
skeletal system. In this study different force distributions among the shoulder muscles are examined. 
The chosen position is a static arm posture of loo of abduction and 30“ internal rotation of the 
humerus. The elbow is flexed 90’. Theoretical analysis of this position is performed by using a 3-D 
computer model of the shoulder where a force distribution is derived by minimising an objective 
function. The different distributions are simulated by manipulating the lower limits of the muscle force 
constrains. In this way an increased cocontraction can be reproduced. For each chosen distribution 
case the stiffness matrix of the entire shoulder joint may be calculated along with the corresponding 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It is shown that the chosen position has a lowest stiffness in a direction 
almost perpendicular to the plane of the humerus and the ulna. Increasing the force in the posterior 
deltoid muscle gives the most effective increase of the least stiff direction. Accordingly, other muscle 
activities are increased as well. 
KINEMATIC 
SINGULARITIES 
IN HUMAN ARM MOTION 
J. Kieffer, J. LenarEiE 
The objective is to study the human arm motion in terms of attainable velocities and 
their relationship with the joint torques and forces applied to the arm. The method is 
based on the manipulability ellipses and singularity theory. A number of examples 
considering how humans use singularities is studied in detail using a 2R planar 
kinematic model of the arm in the first stage and the 6R spatial mechanism in the 
second stage. It is observed by computer simulations that humans take advantages of 
singularity configurations to minimise efforts and reduce fatugue while handling 
weights. The disadvantage is the complexity of velocity limits which make difficult to 
plan the timing of motion. On the other hand, the self-motion of the human arm can 
serve to change the velocity-force properties in almost every point of the workspace.

A DYNAMIC

of Information Transmission, Moscow, Russia 
When sliding the hand 
against 
a rigid surface, 
the motor system 
performs a constrained 
motion; the hand 
is free to move only tangent 
to the surface. 
Movements 
into the surface 
are prevented, 
although in this degree 
of freedom 
the limb can generate 
a force. We asked: 
“What is the control strategy 
used 
by human subjects 
to 
follow the constraints 
of a rigid surface. 
7” We proposed 
two models 
of human compliant motion that we call 
active and 
parsive compliance. We define active compliance 
to be the real-time feedback 
control of contact 
forces. A passively compliant motion would be executed 
in a feedforward manner with respect to the force 
output. A static analysis 
of these 
two models 
predicts 
two different responses 
to unexpected 
changes 
in surface 
orientation. The active compliance model predicts constant forces against the surface, while the passive 
compliance 
model predicts a linear increase 
or decrease 
in force as 
the actual 
and nominal surfaces 
diverge. 
In a previous study we measured 
the performance 
of human 
subjects 
while executing 
a surface 
following 
task, and compared 
the results with responses 
of the two models. The task was performed in a virtual force 
environment, using a force-actuated 
joystick. 
The surface orientation was changed from trial to trial, 
unbeknownst 
to the subject. 
We measured 
changes 
in contact 
force induced 
by changes 
in surface 
orientation. 
By a quasi-static 
analysis 
neither model produced 
an adequate 
prediction of the human response. Force 
patterns for different surface orientations do not diverge continuously for different orientations. For the 
current study, we developed 
a dynamic model of a passive 
control system, and compared its behavior with 
that of human subjects. We have shown that this dynamic model captures 
much better the features of the 
human 
motor response.

In this 
paper 
the problem 
of the competitor’s 
optimal 
velocity 
in a 
race 
is reconsidered. 
The motion 
of an athlete 
is described 
by two ordinary 
differential 
equations: 
the 
first 
one arises 
from 
the 
Newton’s 
second 
law, 
the second 
one describes 
the energy 
transformations 
in the competitor’s 
body. 
Additional 
constraints 
are 
imposed 
as well. 
The problem 
is to 
determine 
the competitor’s 
velocity 
minimizing 
the 
time 
of covering 
the 
given 
distance. 
This 
is a typical 
problem 
of optimal 
control 
and it 
is 
solved 
using 
the 
method of extremization 
of 
linear 
integrals 
by Green’s 
theorem 
(Miele’s 
method). 
The minimum-time 
run can be divided 
into 
three 
phases: 
acceleration, 
cruise 
with 
constant 
velocity 
and negative 
kick 
at 
the 
end of the 
race. 
The minimum-time 
problem 
in competitive 
swimming 
has a 
similar 
solution, 
however, 
the 
first 
phase 
(acceleration) 
is replaced 
by 
gliding 
phase due to relatively 
high 
velocity 
of the competitor

AN INTERACTIVE 
DYNAMIC

OF THE HUMAN 
SHOULDER

Chalmers University of Technology, S-412 96 Gothenburg, Sweden 
The 
shoulder 
is built in a 
CAB system 
using 
a solid 
modeller. 
For 
the 
mechanism 
a 
multi-body 
systems 
module 
linked 
to the 
CAE system 
is used. 
The 
model 
consist 
of four links with 8 degrees 
of freedom. 
The 
joints are 
constrained 
so 
that 
no 
movements 
outside 
the 
anatomic 
ranges 
are 
possible. 
The 
kinematic 
model 
is guided 
by the 
absolute 
position 
of the 
hand, 
and 
the 
system 
calculates the 
movements 
of 
the 
proximal 
limbs 
by use 
of inverse 
kinematics. 
The 
output 
from the model and the model itself are converted 
to an 
invefie 
dynamic 
model. 
The 
output 
from such 
a 
model 
is the 
forces 
and 
torques 
that 
are 
needed 
to drive a dynamic 
model. 
The 
forces 
and 
torques 
acting 
on 
the 
model 
can 
then 
be 
used 
for biomechanical 
calculations. 
The

to create 
the 
inverse

of three

One

finally, one 
that

The 
derivation 
procedure 
consist 
of one 
part 
that 
creates

and 
one 
that 
derivate

The 
output 
files 
from 
the 
multi-body 
system 
is 
the 
position 
of points, 
the 
direction 
of vectors 
and 
the 
value 
of angles 
for each 
time 
step. 
The 
value 
of the 
time 
step 
are 
given 
in the 
input 
file by the 
user. 
A long 
time 
step 
will lead 
to inexact 
velocity 
and 
acceleration 
files 
due 
to numeric 
derivation 
errors. 
To overcome 
this 
the 
subroutine 
creates 
curyes 
from the 
output 
files. 
Future 
work on 
this 
model 
aimes 
at 
estabilishing 
a 
movement 
library 
that 
can 
be 
used 
in creating 
longer 
sequences 
of motion 
and 
in biomechanical 
calculation 
and 
evaluation 
of the 
output 
from 
the 
model. 
The 
biomechanical 
calcula- 
tions 
will, to start 
with, handle 
static 
loading 
situations, 
but 
in a longer 
term, 
a 
dynamic 
analysis 
will be 
developed. 
The 
control 
of movements 
will be 
expanded, 
so 
that 
the

A DYNAMIC 
MODEL OF HUMAN COMPLIANT MOTION

of Information Transmission, Moscow, Russia 
When sliding the hand 
against 
a rigid surface, 
the motor system 
performs a constrained 
motion; the hand 
is free to move only tangent 
to the surface. 
Movements 
into the surface 
are prevented, 
although in this degree 
of freedom 
the limb can generate 
a force. We asked: 
“What is the control strategy 
used 
by human subjects 
to 
follow the constraints 
of a rigid surface. 
7” We proposed 
two models 
of human compliant motion that we call 
active and 
parsive compliance. We define active compliance 
to be the real-time feedback 
control of contact 
forces. A passively compliant motion would be executed 
in a feedforward manner with respect to the force 
output. A static analysis 
of these 
two models 
predicts 
two different responses 
to unexpected 
changes 
in surface 
orientation. The active compliance model predicts constant forces against the surface, while the passive 
compliance 
model predicts a linear increase 
or decrease 
in force as 
the actual 
and nominal surfaces 
diverge. 
In a previous study we measured 
the performance 
of human 
subjects 
while executing 
a surface 
following 
task, and compared 
the results with responses 
of the two models. The task was performed in a virtual force 
environment, using a force-actuated 
joystick. 
The surface orientation was changed from trial to trial, 
unbeknownst 
to the subject. 
We measured 
changes 
in contact 
force induced 
by changes 
in surface 
orientation. 
By a quasi-static 
analysis 
neither model produced 
an adequate 
prediction of the human response. Force 
patterns for different surface orientations do not diverge continuously for different orientations. For the 
current study, we developed 
a dynamic model of a passive 
control system, and compared its behavior with 
that of human subjects. We have shown that this dynamic model captures 
much better the features of the 
human 
motor response. 
MINIMUM-TIME RUNNING AND SWIMMING - AN OPTIMAL CONTROL APPROACH 
Ryszard 
Marofiski

and Applied 
Mechanics, 
Warsaw University 
of Technology, 
Warsaw, 
Poland. 
In this 
paper 
the problem 
of the competitor’s 
optimal 
velocity 
in a 
race 
is reconsidered. 
The motion 
of an athlete 
is described 
by two ordinary 
differential 
equations: 
the 
first 
one arises 
from 
the 
Newton’s 
second 
law, 
the second 
one describes 
the energy 
transformations 
in the competitor’s 
body. 
Additional 
constraints 
are 
imposed 
as well. 
The problem 
is to 
determine 
the competitor’s 
velocity 
minimizing 
the 
time 
of covering 
the 
given 
distance. 
This 
is a typical 
problem 
of optimal 
control 
and it 
is 
solved 
using 
the 
method of extremization 
of 
linear 
integrals 
by Green’s 
theorem 
(Miele’s 
method). 
The minimum-time 
run can be divided 
into 
three 
phases: 
acceleration, 
cruise 
with 
constant 
velocity 
and negative 
kick 
at 
the 
end of the 
race. 
The minimum-time 
problem 
in competitive 
swimming 
has a 
similar 
solution, 
however, 
the 
first 
phase 
(acceleration) 
is replaced 
by 
gliding 
phase due to relatively 
high 
velocity 
of the competitor 
immediately 
after 
the 
jump into 
the water. 
CREATING 
AND CONTROLLING 
AN INTERACTIVE 
DYNAMIC 
MODEL 
OF THE HUMAN 
SHOULDER 
Gunnar Nilsson and Roland hengreen, Dept. of Injury Prevention, 
Chalmers University of Technology, S-412 96 Gothenburg, Sweden 
The 
shoulder 
is built in a 
CAB system 
using 
a solid 
modeller. 
For 
the 
mechanism 
a 
multi-body 
systems 
module 
linked 
to the 
CAE system 
is used. 
The 
model 
consist 
of four links with 8 degrees 
of freedom. 
The 
joints are 
constrained 
so 
that 
no 
movements 
outside 
the 
anatomic 
ranges 
are 
possible. 
The 
kinematic 
model 
is guided 
by the 
absolute 
position 
of the 
hand, 
and 
the 
system 
calculates the 
movements 
of 
the 
proximal 
limbs 
by use 
of inverse 
kinematics. 
The 
output 
from the model and the model itself are converted 
to an 
invefie 
dynamic 
model. 
The 
output 
from such 
a 
model 
is the 
forces 
and 
torques 
that 
are 
needed 
to drive a dynamic 
model. 
The 
forces 
and 
torques 
acting 
on 
the 
model 
can 
then 
be 
used 
for biomechanical 
calculations. 
The 
subroutine 
used 
to create 
the 
inverse 
dynamic 
model 
consist 
of three 
parts. 
One 
that 
handles 
the 
derivation 
of 
positions 
to create 
files with velocity 
and 
accelerations, 
one 
that 
checks 
what 
have 
to be. 
changed 
in the 
original 
input 
file, and, 
finally, one 
that 
builds 
the 
new 
input 
file. 
The 
derivation 
procedure 
consist 
of one 
part 
that 
creates 
curves 
and 
one 
that 
derivate 
the 
curves. 
The 
output 
files 
from 
the 
multi-body 
system 
is 
the 
position 
of points, 
the 
direction 
of vectors 
and 
the 
value 
of angles 
for each 
time 
step. 
The 
value 
of the 
time 
step 
are 
given 
in the 
input 
file by the 
user. 
A long 
time 
step 
will lead 
to inexact 
velocity 
and 
acceleration 
files 
due 
to numeric 
derivation 
errors. 
To overcome 
this 
the 
subroutine 
creates 
curyes 
from the 
output 
files. 
Future 
work on 
this 
model 
aimes 
at 
estabilishing

A human body 
can be replaced 
by a link 
mechanism 
to 
study 
analytically 
its 
rough 
and 
large 
movements. 
The joint 
in 
a human body 
is 
mainly 
rotary 
and spherical 
type. 
As a link 
element 
only 
rotates 
at 
its 
joint, 
it 
is 
convenient 
to 
adopt 
the 
local 
Cartesian 
coordinate 
system 
which 
is 
embedded 
to 
each 
link 
element. 
The rotary 
motion 
of 
elements 
can be explained 
with 
multiplying 
by a current 
coordinate 
matrix. 
If 
a joint 
has 
two 
or 
three 
degrees 
of 
freedom, 
any 
rotated 
state 
of 
link 
elements 
can be obtained 
by 
multiplying 
by two 
or 
three 
coordinate 
matrices 
in 
turn. 
However, 
the 
final 
state 
of 
link 
element 
is 
affected 
by the 
order 
of 
the 
multiplication. 
Since 
the 
link 
element 
at 
the 
spherical 
joint 
actually 
rotates 
toward 
arbitrary 
direction 
at 
once, 
the 
multiplication 
which 
is 
not 
affected 
by the 
order 
of 
rotary 
motion 
should 
be introduced. 
The formulation 
of 
link 
motion 
is 
very 
complex, 
especially 
the 
force 
which 
must 
be given 
by muscle 
at 
a joint 
to 
perform 
a movement 
is 
very 
complicated 
in 
calculation. 
In 
this 
study, 
the 
formulation 
which 
is 
not 
affected 
the 
order 
of 
rotation 
is 
suggested 
and 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
3-link 
system 
is 
developed. 
The formula 
can 
easily 
develop 
for 
the 
increasing 
link 
elements, 
but 
the 
actual 
calculation 
would 
require 
more 
enormous 
load.

It has

that 
model-based 
predictions 
of muscle 
and 
spinal 
motion segment 
forces 
are 
dependent 
on anatomical 
veracity. Two studies

two hypotheses 
in this regard. First, 
are 
predicted 
muscle 
and 
spinal 
forces, 
using 
an 
optimization-based 
model, 
dependent 
on assumptions 
regarding 
muscle 
geometry? 
A sensitivity 
analysis 
showed 
that 
predicted 
forces 
can 
vary greatly 
with 
assumed 
muscle 
lines-of-action, 
particularly 
for muscles 
having 
oblique 
orientations 
and 
for asymmetric 
loads. Second, 
does 
the 
accuracy 
of muscle 
force 
predictions 
increase 
with improved 
geometric 
fidelity? 
EMG data, 
collected 
while subjects 
were 
loading 
in an 
asymmetric 
(twisted) 
posture, 
were 
compared 
to 
optimization-based 
predictions 
of muscle 
forces. Accounting 
for twisting induced 
changes 
in muscle 
and 
spine 
geometry 
led to relatively small but consistent 
changes 
in EMG-force correlations. 
The two sets 
of 
results 
emphasize 
the 
dependency 
of model-based 
predictions 
on geometric 
assumptions, 
yet highlight that 
the 
force 
EMG relationship 
may not be 
substantially 
altered.

Previous 
investigations have indicated that, with respect to gait, the movement patterns and external loads of 
below-knee-amputee 
(BRA) children differ from those of able-bodied 
(AB) children. Also, greater energy 
expenditure 
has 
been 
measured 
for BRA children 
than for AB children during walking. In this study 
mathematical 
modelling has been 
used 
to consider 
if kinematic and 
kinetic differences 
between 
BRA and 
AB children can be 
eliminated 
when using 
currently available 
prosthetic 
designs. 
The 
purpose 
of the 
investigation 
was 
to design 
a 3- 
dimensional model to provide detailed information on the gait of below-knee-amputee 
and of able-bodied 
children. Kinematic and 
kinetic data 
were derived 
from normative 
data

variables 
being the 
proximal forces 
and 
momenta, 
the 
distal forces 
and

and 
the position-time data. The results of the inverse dynamics calculations 
suggest 
that the non-prosthetic 
limb 
experiences 
greater 
loads 
during the 
initial stance 
phase 
than 
does 
the 
leg of the 
AI3 which in turn are 
greater 
than 
the forces in the prosthetic limb. Initial modelling shows that accelerations 
ten times greater 
than normal are 
required 
to compensate 
for the external 
loads 
currently experienced 
by the 
non-prosthetic 
leg if the forces 
at the 
knee 
are 
to equal 
those 
of an AB child. This would appear 
to be an impractical solution to the problem of joint 
load reduction and reduction of the incidence of degenerate 
joint disease 
currently experienced 
in the non- 
prosthetic 
leg of BKA adults

A human body 
can be replaced 
by a link 
mechanism 
to 
study 
analytically 
its 
rough 
and 
large 
movements. 
The joint 
in 
a human body 
is 
mainly 
rotary 
and spherical 
type. 
As a link 
element 
only 
rotates 
at 
its 
joint, 
it 
is 
convenient 
to 
adopt 
the 
local 
Cartesian 
coordinate 
system 
which 
is 
embedded 
to 
each 
link 
element. 
The rotary 
motion 
of 
elements 
can be explained 
with 
multiplying 
by a current 
coordinate 
matrix. 
If 
a joint 
has 
two 
or 
three 
degrees 
of 
freedom, 
any 
rotated 
state 
of 
link 
elements 
can be obtained 
by 
multiplying 
by two 
or 
three 
coordinate 
matrices 
in 
turn. 
However, 
the 
final 
state 
of 
link 
element 
is 
affected 
by the 
order 
of 
the 
multiplication. 
Since 
the 
link 
element 
at 
the 
spherical 
joint 
actually 
rotates 
toward 
arbitrary 
direction 
at 
once, 
the 
multiplication 
which 
is 
not 
affected 
by the 
order 
of 
rotary 
motion 
should 
be introduced. 
The formulation 
of 
link 
motion 
is 
very 
complex, 
especially 
the 
force 
which 
must 
be given 
by muscle 
at 
a joint 
to 
perform 
a movement 
is 
very 
complicated 
in 
calculation. 
In 
this 
study, 
the 
formulation 
which 
is 
not 
affected 
the 
order 
of 
rotation 
is 
suggested 
and 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
3-link 
system 
is 
developed. 
The formula 
can 
easily 
develop 
for 
the 
increasing 
link 
elements, 
but 
the 
actual 
calculation 
would 
require 
more 
enormous 
load. 
GEOMETRIC CONSIDERATIONS 
IN OPTIMIZATION-BASED MODELING OF 
THE TORSO 
MUSCULATURE

It has 
often been 
suggested 
that 
model-based 
predictions 
of muscle 
and 
spinal 
motion segment 
forces 
are 
dependent 
on anatomical 
veracity. Two studies 
were 
designed 
to test 
two hypotheses 
in this regard. First, 
are 
predicted 
muscle 
and 
spinal 
forces, 
using 
an 
optimization-based 
model, 
dependent 
on assumptions 
regarding 
muscle 
geometry? 
A sensitivity 
analysis 
showed 
that 
predicted 
forces 
can 
vary greatly 
with 
assumed 
muscle 
lines-of-action, 
particularly 
for muscles 
having 
oblique 
orientations 
and 
for asymmetric 
loads. Second, 
does 
the 
accuracy 
of muscle 
force 
predictions 
increase 
with improved 
geometric 
fidelity? 
EMG data, 
collected 
while subjects 
were 
loading 
in an 
asymmetric 
(twisted) 
posture, 
were 
compared 
to 
optimization-based 
predictions 
of muscle 
forces. Accounting 
for twisting induced 
changes 
in muscle 
and 
spine 
geometry 
led to relatively small but consistent 
changes 
in EMG-force correlations. 
The two sets 
of 
results 
emphasize 
the 
dependency 
of model-based 
predictions 
on geometric 
assumptions, 
yet highlight that 
the 
force 
EMG relationship 
may not be 
substantially 
altered. 
MATHEMATICAL 
MODELLINC 
APPLIED 
TO GAIT OF BELOW-KNEE-AMPUTEE 
AND ABLE- 
BODIED CHILDREN

Previous 
investigations have indicated that, with respect to gait, the movement patterns and external loads of 
below-knee-amputee 
(BRA) children differ from those of able-bodied 
(AB) children. Also, greater energy 
expenditure 
has 
been 
measured 
for BRA children 
than for AB children during walking. In this study 
mathematical 
modelling has been 
used 
to consider 
if kinematic and 
kinetic differences 
between 
BRA and 
AB children can be 
eliminated 
when using 
currently available 
prosthetic 
designs. 
The 
purpose 
of the 
investigation 
was 
to design 
a 3- 
dimensional model to provide detailed information on the gait of below-knee-amputee 
and of able-bodied 
children. Kinematic and 
kinetic data 
were derived 
from normative 
data 
previously 
established 
for BRA and AB 
children. 
A program 
was 
written to solve 
the 
Newtonian 
equations 
of motion as 
applied 
to a 
body 
segment 
for any 
one 
of the variables. 
These. 
variables 
being the 
proximal forces 
and 
momenta, 
the 
distal forces 
and 
moments, 
and 
the position-time data. The results of the inverse dynamics calculations 
suggest 
that the non-prosthetic 
limb 
experiences 
greater 
loads 
during the 
initial stance 
phase 
than 
does 
the 
leg of the 
AI3 which in turn are 
greater 
than 
the forces in the prosthetic limb. Initial modelling shows that accelerations 
ten times greater 
than normal are 
required 
to compensate 
for the external 
loads 
currently experienced 
by the 
non-prosthetic 
leg if the forces 
at the 
knee 
are 
to equal 
those 
of an AB child. This would appear 
to be an impractical solution to the problem of joint 
load reduction and reduction of the incidence of degenerate 
joint disease 
currently experienced 
in the non- 
prosthetic 
leg of BKA adults

The aim of this study 
was to develop 
a 16-l& 3 dimensional, 
mathematical 
model 
of the human 
musculo-skeletal 
system 
which could be used 
to solve 
inverse 
dynamics 
problems 
related 
to human 
movements. 
The 
model 
of the 
human 
musculo-skeletal 
system 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
a two-level arrangement. 
On the first level. 
the 
human 
skeleton 
is represented 
as 
a mechanical 
system 
of IG 
rigid bodies 
interconnected 
by fi-ictionless 
ball and 
socket 
joints. The dynamics 
of the model 
is described 
by equations 
based 
on the 
linear and 
angular 
momentum 
theorems 
for a rigid body. 
The second 
level of the model 
describes 
the actions 
of 32 muscle 
groups. 
Two 
approaches 
for the determination 
of muscle 
forces 
were 
implemented 
in the model: 
an optimization and 
an 
reduction 
approach. 
The software 
package 
HUMMOT was 
written for the 
IBM PC/AT 
to facilitate problem 
solving with the model. Input required 
for the model 
includes 
body landmark 
coordiiates; force platform data; 
subject 
mass-inertial 
characteristics; 
and 
morphometric 
characteristics 
of muscles. 
A series 
of experiments 
was 
undertaken 
to validate 
the 
model. Results 
of the 
validation showed 
a good 
agreement 
between 
the 
calculated 
(e.g., 
muscle 
forces) 
and 
recorded 
(e.g.,

EMG) characteristics 
of movements.

Using a 3D finite element 
model (FEM) which preserves, 
as 
closely as 
possible, 
the geometrical characteristics of the scapula, the aim of this study is to find the 
distribution of some 
mechanical 
characteristics 
of the scapula. 
The geometry 
of the scapula 
was reconstructed 
using a dataset 
consisting 
of the 
coordinates 
of 464 points measured 
on the surface 
of a real bone 
on approximate 
cross 
sections 
in the transversal 
plane. To create the mesh 
geometry (in the sense 
of finite 
element 
analysis) 
we preffered the use 
of I-DEAS VI.i(s) FEM package 
from Structural 
Dynamics Research Corporation. Thus, we obtained a model with 1012 parabolic 
tetrahedronal 
elements 
and about 2500 nodes. 
The study presents 
the results obtained 
for 0”, 30”, 60”, 90“, 120“, 150“ 
and maximal abduction. For 0’ abduction, taking into 
consideration 
only the weight of the arm, the minimum principal stress 
has 
a variation 
between 
-1.61 N/mm* and 0.46 N/mm’. 
Our intention for future is to collect data 
concerning the density distribution of 
the bone 
in the scapula 
in the idea to realize a more realist model, and according to our 
goals already mentioned, to realize a more refined model for the glenohumeral 
joint.

The idea 
of this study 
and implicit its goal is to present 
the fact that between 
the 
human 
walking mechanism 
and mechanisms 
type Tchebichev, in the synthesis 
process 
exist some 
natural 
invariants. Concerning 
the 
description 
of this trajectory we have 
used 
both data from the literature Alexander(l983) and Baciu( 
1974) and from our own 
measurements. 
For measurements 
we have 
used 
a general-use 
video camera 
with simple 
markers attached 
to the hip, knee and ankle. In the next step we have realised the 
synthesis 
of a mechanism 
type Tchebichev 
using 
as 
an imposed 
trajectory the trajectory 
described 
by the markers 
fixed on hip, knee 
and 
ankle. For the synthesis 
we have used 
the general method 
of 9 imposed 
points. In this study we have 
presented 
only the case 
of the human 
walking mechanism 
in the hypothesis 
of planar motion.Consequently, 
our 
intention for the future are to extend 
the study 
both to three 
dimensional 
trajectories 
and 
to other (bio)mechanisms.

The idea 
of this study 
and implicit its goal is to present 
the fact that between 
the 
human 
walking mechanism 
and mechanisms 
type Tchebichev, in the synthesis 
process 
exist some 
natural 
invariants. Concerning 
the 
description 
of this trajectory we have 
used 
both data from the literature Alexander(l983) and Baciu( 
1974) and from our own 
measurements. 
For measurements 
we have 
used 
a general-use 
video camera 
with simple 
markers attached 
to the hip, knee and ankle. In the next step we have realised the 
synthesis 
of a mechanism 
type Tchebichev 
using 
as 
an imposed 
trajectory the trajectory 
described 
by the markers 
fixed on hip, knee 
and 
ankle. For the synthesis 
we have used 
the general method 
of 9 imposed 
points. In this study we have 
presented 
only the case 
of the human 
walking mechanism 
in the hypothesis 
of planar motion.Consequently, 
our 
intention for the future are to extend 
the study 
both to three 
dimensional 
trajectories 
and 
to other (bio)mechanisms.

The assessment 
of the strains 
and the stresses 
withstanded 
by an internal fixation device remains 
a difficult 
problem 
to solve but also a powerful way to optimize a restauration 
technique. 
In this view, we used 
a 3D finite 
element 
model of the lombo-sacral 
region of the spine 
to study diierent features 
of a Cotrel-Dubousset 
(CD) 
hator. A specific 
software 
program 
was 
used 
for this study 
which enables 
the reconstruction 
of a persona&d 3D 
finite element 
model of the lumbar spine 
including a simplified model of the pelvis. The lomho-sacral 
fixation 
device 
studied 
was a CD lombo-sacral 
instrumentation. 
The anchorages 
between 
the screws 
and the hone were 
assumed 
to be perfect. The links between 
the screws 
and 
the rods 
were modelled 
in a refined 
way using non linear 
spring elements. 
Two devices 
of transverse 
traction were added 
to the fixation device and were pre-stressed. 
Flexion, extension and torsion cases were studied. The lesion associated with this simulation was a 
spondilolysthesis 
of the fifth lombar vertebra. The displacements 
of the centre of the vertebral bodies were 
computed 
in order to characterize 
the global behaviour of the segment 
with load-displacement 
curves. The 
locations 
of the centres 
of rotation between 
L5 and Sl were also studied 
for plane 
flexion/extension 
movements. 
This centre 
of rotation is predicted 
to be located 
in the posterior 
part of the intervertebral 
disc, to move forwards 
when the flexion moment increases, 
and to move backwards 
when the extension 
moment increases. 
When a 
posterior 
fixation device is added, 
the centre 
of rotation is located 
at the level of the spinous 
processes 
and does 
not move anymore 
in a significant way when the loading increases. 
This method also enabled 
us to study the 
efforts passing 
through the fixation device.

- non-linear 
objective 
tinctions 
equal 
to the sum 
of muscle 
stresses 
raised 
to the nth power (n = 2, n = 3, etc) are 
incompatible 
with the 
physiologically 
sound 
requirement 
of maximization 
of endurance. 
It is thus 
concluded 
that in order to render 
an 
objective 
fimction physiologically 
reasonable 
one has 
to search 
beyond 
the domain 
of power functions. 
Necessary

PHYSIOLOGICALLY BASED CRITERIA OF MUSCLE FORCE 
PREDICTION - BASIC PRINCIPLES 
OF CONSTRUCTION 
Adam Siemiefiski 
Biomechanics 
Laboratory, 
Academy 
of Physical 
Education, 
Wroclaw, Poland 
The work deals 
with the use 
of optimization 
schemes 
to predict 
individual muscle 
forces 
in redundant 
biomechanical 
systems. 
It is shown 
that - contrary 
to the common 
assertion 
- non-linear 
objective 
tinctions 
equal 
to the sum 
of muscle 
stresses 
raised 
to the nth power (n = 2, n = 3, etc) are 
incompatible 
with the 
physiologically 
sound 
requirement 
of maximization 
of endurance. 
It is thus 
concluded 
that in order to render 
an 
objective 
fimction physiologically 
reasonable 
one has 
to search 
beyond 
the domain 
of power functions. 
Necessary 
conditions 
of physiological 
compatibility 
are 
derived 
and 
a class 
of really 
physiologically 
based 
objective 
functions 
is defined. 
Some 
important 
consequences 
of using 
this new 
type of objective 
tinctions 
are 
discussed 
and 
an interpretation 
in terms 
of multicriteria 
optimization 
is proposed. 
An example 
is 
presented 
showing 
that the most 
significant 
differences 
between 
the predictions 
of the new criteria and 
those 
obtained 
using 
the traditional ones 
occur when muscle 
forces 
approach 
their maximum 
possible 
values.

Computer

used 
to investigate 
the 
effect of different patterns 
of pedal 
force application 
during 
cycling. Three 
experimental 
patterns 
of force application 
were 
analysed: 
1. 
pedalling 
in a direction 
always 
tangential 
to the 
direction of pedal 
movement 
with a power 
output 
pattern 
similar to measured 
values; 
2. pedalling

and 
3. applymg

calculated 
to minimise the

using

and 
work calculated

joints was 
compared 
between 
the 
measured 
values 
and 
the 
three 
models 
for eight subjects. 
Results 
showed 
that 
pedalling 
in a tangential 
direction 
produced 
significantly higher 
work loads 
for the 
hip and 
knee 
flexors. This was 
particularly evident 
for the 
constant 
power 
model 
where 
the 
total work of extensor 
groups 
dropped 
from 236 
to 143 
Joules, 
while work done 
by the flexors rose 
from 126

reduced

The simulation of a complex body model in collision and persistent contact with hard surfaces in 3 
dimensions is crucial for the desigu and test ol control schemes, in particular of those for standing, walking 
and climbing. 
However, the asymmetric consi.raint imposed upon motion by hard surfaces is not easily 
simulated, a.s 
with conventional approaches nunlcrical irlstabilities frequently arise rendering a simulation 
impossible. 
Based on an approved human body model (17 segments 4: 
7 t1.o.f.) described and provided by Hatze 
(J. Biomech. 13:S33, 19SO), we have developped a simulation that copes with the numerical instabilities 
by incorporating 
a feedback scheme known from control theory, as suggested by Ostermeyer (in: Haug 
and Deyo, editors, Real-Time Integration 
h4ethods for h4echanical System Simulation, 
Springer, 1991). 
Further we a.dded a simula.tion of joint limits and passive visco-elastic torques. 
These improvements a.llow us to simulate the collision and conta.ct of the human body with a large 
class of hard surfaces in 3 dimensions. To illust,ra.te the capabilities of our software package, the simulation 
program has been a.ppliecl to landing on an oblique surface. 
FOREARM MOVEMENTS ANALYSIS WITH A SEQUENTIAL NEURONAL NETWORK

Test persons were asked to aim at targets in the working space of the forearm by flexion/extension and 
supinationlpronation with fixed elbow in a choice reaction time paradigm. Using splints with three passive markers 
for the forearm and three for the upper arm, the trajectories of the 6 marker were measured with a TV based 3D- 
system ( Elite@). We defined the angle of elbow flexion and the angle of forearm supination in terms of the 
measured rotation axes of the arm with a preclslon of 5 degraes. 
We have investigated the usefulness of neuronal rietworks with an architecture in which 3 priori information 
about the motor control circuits is imbedded, in order to study free aiming movements of the forearm. The 
measured angles, a few hundred data points for each trajectory, were used to train the neural networks with 
recurrent architectures. The input of the network was a superposition of step functions which were the target 
destinations of the hand. The original Jordan architecture, a recurrent neural network with a back propagation 
learning algorithm. was not able to team the measured data, but in the modified network the difference between 
the simulated and the measured trajectories of the validation data was in the range of the measurement noise. 
The validation showed that our neural network is able to generalize the learned aimlng movements of two degrees 
of freedom to any start and end point. The improved neural network used a minimal number of neurons, delays 
instead of exponentially decaying sums, and a training algorithm which prevented the storage of wrong information 
in the loops.

Bone 
has 
to be understood 
as an elastic, 
load bearing 
compound 
material 
out of collagen 
and 
hydroxyapatite 
crlstals, 
penetrated 
by interconnected 
cells 
(osteocyt&. This structure 
is deformed 
under 
functional 
load according 
to its elastic 
properties 
and 
loadiig conditions. 
Osteocytes 
are 
recording 
function 
by measuring 
local 
strains. 
Activated 
cells 
start 
to remodel 
the architecture 
of 
bone 
according 
to the

On the basis 
of this cell related 
theory 
a threediiensional

(ANSYS) 
of the bone 
around 
an osseo- 
integrated 
cylindrical 
dental implant 
was 
generated. 
Conditions 
of interfaces 
were 
generated 
according 
to the in-vivo 
situation. A strain related algorithm (FEMR) of the cell-biology-based 
model for modification 
of the elastic 
propert& of the 
bone 
was 
developed. 
Initial conditions 
are isotropic moduli of elasticity for spongy 
bone 300 N/mm2 and 8000 N/mm*. For 
simulation of remodeling 
profile the strain FE&analysis of functional loaded bone was followed by the 
modification

using 
the 
FEMR

was 
developed. 
Initial conditions 
are isotropic moduli of elasticity for spongy 
bone 300 N/mm2 and 8000 N/mm*. For 
simulation of remodeling

POSTURE AND THE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF THE LUMBAR SPINE 
M.A. Adams, D.S. McNally, H. Chii, 
P. Dolan. 
Department 
of Anatomy, Umversity of Bristol, Bristol BSl XS, U.K. 
The effect of posture 
on spinal compressive 
strength 
was 
examined 
in a series 
of three experiments 
on 
cadaveric 
material. Twenty-nine lumbar “motion segments”, 
consisting 
of two vertebrae 
and the intervening 
disc and ligaments, were compressed 
while positioned 
in various angles 
of flexion and extension. In the first 
experiment, 
load sharing 
between 
the disc, the apophyseal 
joint surfaces, 
and the intervertebral ligaments 
was 
inferred from changes 
in intra-discal pressure 
(IDP) measured 
by a transducer mounted in the side of a 1.3mm 
diameter 
needle. IDP was compared 
before and 
after sectioning 
of the ligaments 
and apophyseal 
joints. 
Results 
showed 
that extension 
caused 
the apophyseal 
joints to become 
load-bearing, 
and damage 
could occur 
at compressive 
loads 
as low as 
5OON. Flexion angles 
greater 
than about 
75% of the full range 
of flexion (as 
defined 
by the posterior ligaments) 
generated 
high tensile 
forces 
in these 
ligaments, 
and caused 
substantial 
increases 
in IDP. The optimum range 
for resisting 
compression 
therefore 
appeared 
to be O-7546 
flexion. The 
second 
experiment 
compared 
the distribution of compressive 
stress 
within the disc at the endpoints 
of this 
range, 
and showed 
that at 0% flexion, high concentrations 
of stress 
occur in the posterior a~ulus of many 
discs, wheras 
an even distribution was usually found at 75% flexion. However, the third experiment showed 
that there 
was no significant difference in the compressive 
strength 
of motion segments 
positioned in 0% and 
75 
96 
flexion. A comparison 
of the range 
of flexion/extension 
movements 
in-vivo and in-vitro suggested 
that, 
in life, a position of moderate 
flexion optimises 
the loading of the intervertebral discs 
and apophyseal 
joints. 
We conclude 
that the previously-demonstrated 
benefits 
of a lumbar lordosis do not persist at high load levels, 
and 
that the lumbar spine should 
be moderately 
flexed when subjected 
to high compressive 
forces. 
CALCULATED ACTIVATION OF CAT SOLEUS MUSCLE DURING LOCOMOTION

T2N lN4 
Activation of the soleus 
muscle in the cat was calculated 
continuously during level treadmill walking at 
speeds 
of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 m/s. Activation was defined as the measured 
muscle 
force divided by the theoreti- 
cal maximum force based 
on instantaneous 
force-length-velocity properties 
of the soleus 
fiber. Force of the 
soleus 
muscle was measured 
using E-shaped 
tendon force transducers. 
Soleus 
fiber lengths were calculated 
from the experimentally determined muscle-tendon lengths (obtained using surface markers and anthro- 
pometric measurements) 
and a muscle model. The muscle model allowed for tendon elongation, and for 
changes 
in fiber lengths and angles of pinnation by assuming 
a constant 
muscle width. Maximum possible 
force in the soleus muscle was then calculated using the computed 
fiber length along with force-length and 
force-velocity relations, obtained from the literature. Results showed 
that fiber shortening 
velocity increased 
during the stance 
phase of walking with increased 
locomotor speed. 
As a result, the theoretical maximum 
force decreased with increasing locomotor speeds. Peak soleus forces increased (22%) with increased 
locomotor speed while peak activation during the stance 
phase increased 
to a larger degree (100%). The 
theoretical activation calculated in this study reflect the experimentally observed 
activation (i.e. integrated 
EMG, Henog et al., 1993 
ISB) well. 
THE RELATlONSHIl’S BETWEEN THE CENTER OF GRAVlTY

The purpose 
of this study 
is to indicate 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
center 
of gravity (C.G.) of a running 
home 
and 
the C.G. of the rider. 
The subjects 
used 
in this study 
were 
two male 
and 
one 
female 
thoroughbred 
race 
horses 
in training. 
The three 
homes 
were 
filmed galloping 
at 
two different speeds. 
The same 
skilled rider rode 
in all the 
trials. The method 
for determining 
the C.G. of a horse 
was 
reported 
at this last 
ISB congress 
by our colleagues. 
The vertical displacement 
of the C.G. 
of horae 
and 
a rider indicated 
lower values 
in high speed 
than 
in low speed. 
And the 
values 
were 
lower in the horses 
than 
in the rider. 
However, 
the 
vertical displacement 
of the shoulder 
and 
the hip points 
am 
greater 
in the horse 
at high speed. 
We 
concluded 
that this result 
was 
caused 
by the 
rotation 
of the 
trunk around 
about 
the C.G. 
on the aagital 
plane 
which takes 
place 
to avoid kicking the 
ground 
with the 
front and 
hind limbs simultaneously. 
The vertical distance 
between 
the C.G. of a horse 
and 
rider during one 
stride 
was 
5.8 
cm at high speed. 
19.0 
cm at low speed. 
It is interesting 
to note 
that when 
the running 
speed 
is three 
times 
faster, 
the distance 
between 
the C.G. 
of the horse 
and 
the rider is about l/3. At high speed, 
the 
rider easily 
adjusts 
his 
body 
to the locomotion 
of the 
home. 
The pattern 
of the vertical distance 
curve 
was 
similar at both 
speeds. 
We 
concluded 
that 
this similar pattern 
appeared 
due 
to the 
same 
walking pattern 
(gallop). 
even 
though 
the 
running 
speed 
was 
different.

POSTURE AND THE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF THE LUMBAR SPINE 
M.A. Adams, D.S. McNally, H. Chii, 
P. Dolan. 
Department 
of Anatomy, Umversity of Bristol, Bristol BSl XS, U.K. 
The effect of posture 
on spinal compressive 
strength 
was 
examined 
in a series 
of three experiments 
on 
cadaveric 
material. Twenty-nine lumbar “motion segments”, 
consisting 
of two vertebrae 
and the intervening 
disc and ligaments, were compressed 
while positioned 
in various angles 
of flexion and extension. In the first 
experiment, 
load sharing 
between 
the disc, the apophyseal 
joint surfaces, 
and the intervertebral ligaments 
was 
inferred from changes 
in intra-discal pressure 
(IDP) measured 
by a transducer mounted in the side of a 1.3mm 
diameter 
needle. IDP was compared 
before and 
after sectioning 
of the ligaments 
and apophyseal 
joints. 
Results 
showed 
that extension 
caused 
the apophyseal 
joints to become 
load-bearing, 
and damage 
could occur 
at compressive 
loads 
as low as 
5OON. Flexion angles 
greater 
than about 
75% of the full range 
of flexion (as 
defined 
by the posterior ligaments) 
generated 
high tensile 
forces 
in these 
ligaments, 
and caused 
substantial 
increases 
in IDP. The optimum range 
for resisting 
compression 
therefore 
appeared 
to be O-7546 
flexion. The 
second 
experiment 
compared 
the distribution of compressive 
stress 
within the disc at the endpoints 
of this 
range, 
and showed 
that at 0% flexion, high concentrations 
of stress 
occur in the posterior a~ulus of many 
discs, wheras 
an even distribution was usually found at 75% flexion. However, the third experiment showed 
that there 
was no significant difference in the compressive 
strength 
of motion segments 
positioned in 0% and 
75 
96 
flexion. A comparison 
of the range 
of flexion/extension 
movements 
in-vivo and in-vitro suggested 
that, 
in life, a position of moderate 
flexion optimises 
the loading of the intervertebral discs 
and apophyseal 
joints. 
We conclude 
that the previously-demonstrated 
benefits 
of a lumbar lordosis do not persist at high load levels, 
and 
that the lumbar spine should 
be moderately 
flexed when subjected 
to high compressive 
forces. 
CALCULATED ACTIVATION OF CAT SOLEUS MUSCLE DURING LOCOMOTION 
T.L. Allinger and W. Herzog*

of Mechanical Engineering, *Faculty of Physical 
Education

T2N lN4 
Activation of the soleus 
muscle in the cat was calculated 
continuously during level treadmill walking at 
speeds 
of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 m/s. Activation was defined as the measured 
muscle 
force divided by the theoreti- 
cal maximum force based 
on instantaneous 
force-length-velocity properties 
of the soleus 
fiber. Force of the 
soleus 
muscle was measured 
using E-shaped 
tendon force transducers. 
Soleus 
fiber lengths were calculated 
from the experimentally determined muscle-tendon lengths (obtained using surface markers and anthro- 
pometric measurements) 
and a muscle model. The muscle model allowed for tendon elongation, and for 
changes 
in fiber lengths and angles of pinnation by assuming 
a constant 
muscle width. Maximum possible 
force in the soleus muscle was then calculated using the computed 
fiber length along with force-length and 
force-velocity relations, obtained from the literature. Results showed 
that fiber shortening 
velocity increased 
during the stance 
phase of walking with increased 
locomotor speed. 
As a result, the theoretical maximum 
force decreased with increasing locomotor speeds. Peak soleus forces increased (22%) with increased 
locomotor speed while peak activation during the stance 
phase increased 
to a larger degree (100%). The 
theoretical activation calculated in this study reflect the experimentally observed 
activation (i.e. integrated 
EMG, Henog et al., 1993 
ISB) well. 
THE RELATlONSHIl’S BETWEEN THE CENTER OF GRAVlTY 
OF A RUNNING HORSE AND A RlDER 
Katsuhiro Amano, Hiroshi Sakuraoka 
and Kihachi lshii 
Kanto Gakuen University, Liberal Arts Department, 
200 Fujiaku, Ohta-city, Gunma 373, Japan. 
The purpose 
of this study 
is to indicate 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
center 
of gravity (C.G.) of a running 
home 
and 
the C.G. of the rider. 
The subjects 
used 
in this study 
were 
two male 
and 
one 
female 
thoroughbred 
race 
horses 
in training. 
The three 
homes 
were 
filmed galloping 
at 
two different speeds. 
The same 
skilled rider rode 
in all the 
trials. The method 
for determining 
the C.G. of a horse 
was 
reported 
at this last 
ISB congress 
by our colleagues. 
The vertical displacement 
of the C.G. 
of horae 
and 
a rider indicated 
lower values 
in high speed 
than 
in low speed. 
And the 
values 
were 
lower in the horses 
than 
in the rider. 
However, 
the 
vertical displacement 
of the shoulder 
and 
the hip points 
am 
greater 
in the horse 
at high speed. 
We 
concluded 
that this result 
was 
caused 
by the 
rotation 
of the 
trunk around 
about 
the C.G. 
on the aagital 
plane 
which takes 
place 
to avoid kicking the 
ground 
with the 
front and 
hind limbs simultaneously. 
The vertical distance 
between 
the C.G. of a horse 
and 
rider during one 
stride 
was 
5.8 
cm at high speed. 
19.0 
cm at low speed. 
It is interesting 
to note 
that when 
the running 
speed 
is three 
times 
faster, 
the distance 
between 
the C.G. 
of the horse 
and 
the rider is about l/3. At high speed, 
the 
rider easily 
adjusts 
his 
body 
to the locomotion 
of the 
home. 
The pattern 
of the vertical distance 
curve 
was 
similar at both 
speeds. 
We 
concluded 
that 
this similar pattern 
appeared 
due 
to the 
same 
walking pattern 
(gallop). 
even 
though 
the 
running 
speed 
was 
different.

The forelimb kinematics of 23 horses 
trotting at 4m/s on a high-speed 
treadmill were recorded 
using a modified CODA-3 apparatus. 
Incorrect location of the markers by the investigator, differences 
in conformation 
and lack of anatomical 
landmarks 
on the hoof, cause 
artificial differences 
between 
joint 
angle-time diagrams of different horses. In this study these diagrams were corrected with 
respectively the joint angles recorded 
at square 
stance 
(‘stance file’) or those recorded 
at the trot at 
the time of maximum ‘stance 
flexion’ of the distal interphalangeal 
joint. 
After both corrections the mean standard deviation (-SD) over a complete stride cycle of the 
averaged 
joint angle-time curves of the group decreased. 
The variation in metacarpophalangeal 
and 
distal interphalangeal 
joint motion within the total group was most affected. However, after ‘stance 
file’ correction it is easier 
for the clinician to interpretate 
joint angle-time diagrams by referring to a 
qualitative reference 
point. 
By correcting individual joint angle-time diagrams the SD of kinematic data of the total group 
was reduced 
and thus better represented 
the true variation in locomotion patterns within the group. 
Standardization of joint angle-time diagrams also facilitates mutual comparison and exchange of 
clinical kinematic information between 
different (equine) 
gait labs.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ACCELEROMETRIC AND KlNEMATlC MEASUREMENTS 
IN A RUNNING HORSE 
E. Barrey, P. Galloux and J.P. Valette. INRA, SGQA Groupe 
cheval, Jouy-en Josas, France. 
An accelerometric belt was developed for gait evaluation in horses. The purpose of this 
communication was to investigate the relationship between acceleration of the sternum and 
kinematics of the limbs of a horse walking and trotting on a treadmill. The device consisted of two 
accelerometers measuring acceleration at the sternum in the longitudinal and dorso-ventral axes of 
the horse. Another accelerometer was fixed with a plastic strap on the lateral wall of the hoof to 
detect accurately the instant of hoof impact and Iii off. The phases of the limb cycle were 
determined by using a synchronized video camera. 
The results suggested that 
the shape of the acceleration curves of the sternum were 
precisely related to the mouvements of the limbs. The patterns of the dorso-ventral acceleration 
curve were very constant in time for a steady state gait. The symmetry of the motions could be 
appreciate by comparing the half stride signals. The longitudinal acceleration curves were less 
repeatkive than the dorso-ventral ones. The forward acceleration developed by the hindlimbs during 
the propulsion phase seemed to be greater than the forelimbs. lt was concluded that this device 
could be used in practice for gait analysis by extracting both kinematic and kinetic parameters from 
acceleration data. 
ADAPTATION OF THE VESTIJWLAR SENSORY 
SYSTEM TO MICROGRAVITY

The paper 
reviews 
the results 
of a number 
of experiments 
in which aspects 
of vestibular 
function 
have 
been 
investigated 
during space 
flight or by comparison 
of pre- and 
post-flight 
responses. 
The major impact of the 
sensory 
rearrangement 
engendered 
by exposure 
to microgravity 
is on the otolith organs 
and 
other 
meehanorece.ptors 
which respond 
to inertial forces. In m&gravity the loss 
of static 
information about 
the spatial 
orientation 
of the 
body leads 
to an adaptive 
reduction 
in gain 
of otolithic msponses, 
manifest 
by a diminution in 
the amplitude 
of ocular 
counter-rolling 
and 
an 
iuerease 
in the threshold 
of perception 
of whole-body, 
linear 
oscillation. The. 
utility of otolitbic iuformatiou 
in microgravity 
lies in the sipnnlline 
of transient 
translational 
movement 
of the head. There is an adaptive 
re&terpretation of otolithic signals 
such 
that body 
tilt in lg induces 
sensations 
of translation 
rather than 
pure tilt. 
The semieireular 
canals, 
being 
closed 
fluid filled systems, 
should 
continue 
to function iu space 
as 
on 
earth, 
but reports 
of OseiIlopsia 
by astronauts 
early 
in flight implies 
that the dynamics 
of the vestibule-ocular 
reflex 
(VOR) may 
be altered. There is evidence 
that the gain 
of the 
vertical 
VOR (induced 
by augtdar 
head 
movements 
in pitch) is initially decreased, 
but after 23 days 
in orbit the 
gain 
is greater 
than 
the pre-tlight level. Likewise, 
studies 
of the horizontal 
VOR have 
shown 
an 
increase 
in gain 
which 
is accompanied 
by a reduction 
in the long 
time constant 
of the canal 
dynamics; 
similar changes 
have 
also 
been 
detected, 
post-flight, 
in the primary afferents 
of rhesus 
monkeys.

We investigated to which extent propeller efficiency depends on assumptions about the flow pattern, 
the form of the animal, the precise kinematics and thus of behavior. Efficiency values were obtained by 
measurement of the kinematics of fish swimming in a water tunnel and applying hydrodynamic theories 
modeling the instationary flow around the fish or its caudal fin as well as by the measurement of the flow in the 
wake of swimming fish. The estimated values range from 30 90 to 90 %. This variation is due to the following 
factors: 1. Method of calculation: 
ZD-wing theory (ca. 30 %), 3D-flow around a waving plate (ca. 57 %), 
small amplitude slender body theory (ca. 9 1 %). Estimates obtained from the flow yielded (74 96 f 5 % SD, n 
= 5). 2. Movement: Moment balance requires nonlinear patterns for subcarangiform swimmers. The slope of 
the amplitude envelope in the region of the caudal fin has a strong influence on the estimated efficiency. 
3. Form: Triangular shapes result in higher efficiencies for caudat increasing amplitudes of deflection. 4. 
Behavior: Intra-individual 
variations of the swimming stile influences thrust but does not significantly affect 
efficiency. 
We propose that efficiency and drag (= thrust) are equal important factors that can not be separated if 
economy of locomotion must be enhanced. If swimming styles and form are modified a gain in economy by

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ACCELEROMETRIC AND KlNEMATlC MEASUREMENTS 
IN A RUNNING HORSE

cheval, Jouy-en Josas, France. 
An accelerometric belt was developed for gait evaluation in horses. The purpose of this 
communication was to investigate the relationship between acceleration of the sternum and 
kinematics of the limbs of a horse walking and trotting on a treadmill. The device consisted of two 
accelerometers measuring acceleration at the sternum in the longitudinal and dorso-ventral axes of 
the horse. Another accelerometer was fixed with a plastic strap on the lateral wall of the hoof to 
detect accurately the instant of hoof impact and Iii off. The phases of the limb cycle were 
determined by using a synchronized video camera. 
The results suggested that 
the shape of the acceleration curves of the sternum were 
precisely related to the mouvements of the limbs. The patterns of the dorso-ventral acceleration 
curve were very constant in time for a steady state gait. The symmetry of the motions could be 
appreciate by comparing the half stride signals. The longitudinal acceleration curves were less 
repeatkive than the dorso-ventral ones. The forward acceleration developed by the hindlimbs during 
the propulsion phase seemed to be greater than the forelimbs. lt was concluded that this device 
could be used in practice for gait analysis by extracting both kinematic and kinetic parameters from 
acceleration data.

We investigated to which extent propeller efficiency depends on assumptions about the flow pattern, 
the form of the animal, the precise kinematics and thus of behavior. Efficiency values were obtained by 
measurement of the kinematics of fish swimming in a water tunnel and applying hydrodynamic theories 
modeling the instationary flow around the fish or its caudal fin as well as by the measurement of the flow in the 
wake of swimming fish. The estimated values range from 30 90 to 90 %. This variation is due to the following 
factors: 1. Method of calculation: 
ZD-wing theory (ca. 30 %), 3D-flow around a waving plate (ca. 57 %), 
small amplitude slender body theory (ca. 9 1 %). Estimates obtained from the flow yielded (74 96 f 5 % SD, n 
= 5). 2. Movement: Moment balance requires nonlinear patterns for subcarangiform swimmers. The slope of 
the amplitude envelope in the region of the caudal fin has a strong influence on the estimated efficiency. 
3. Form: Triangular shapes result in higher efficiencies for caudat increasing amplitudes of deflection. 4. 
Behavior: Intra-individual 
variations of the swimming stile influences thrust but does not significantly affect 
efficiency. 
We propose that efficiency and drag (= thrust) are equal important factors that can not be separated if 
economy of locomotion must be enhanced. If swimming styles and form are modified a gain in economy by 
drag reduction can by far outweigh an accompanying loss due to decreased 
efficiency.

EFFECTS OF FOOT POSITION ON HIP JOINT TORQUES DURING NORMAL GAIT

We speculate 
that foot position plays a role in the torsional loading at the hip and that the development of such 
an adaptation 
may prevent (or perhaps 
promote) implant loosening in patients undergoing a total hip replacement. The 
purpose 
of this study was to understand 
how the torques at the hip are affected by foot position. We studied 12 normal 
healthy adults with a mean age of 27 while they performed 3 walking trials each of normal walking, walking with their 
right foot externally rotated approximately 45’ and walking with their right foot internally rotated approximately 45’. 
Displacement and force plate data -were 
coilected simultaneously and resultant 
joint torques at the right hip were derived 
using GaitLab software developed 
by Vaughan et al. (1992). All results in this study are for the right hip joint. The inter- 
subject 
torques 
produced 
during normal walking exhibited very repeatable 
patterns 
for torque production in all three 
planes. 
When walking with the foot internally rotated no significant differences were found when comparing the torques to those 
produced 
during normal walking. When walking with the foot externally rotated 
no significant differences, when compared 
with normal walking, were found for flexion/extension or abductiotiadduction torque production. Upon examination of 
the individual internal/external torque curves, 11 out of 12 subjects 
produced a decreased 
external rotation torque during 
mid- to terminal stance 
when the right foot was externally rotated. We performed an analysis of variance and Tukey’s 
multiple comparison procedure, which proved this difference to be significant with a p value of less than .05. It may be 
that aseptic 
loosening in THR occurs through high torsional loads 
and this decrease 
in external torque production suggests 
a possible strategy that could be employed to reduce 
torsional loading at the hip joint. It is our intention to extend this 
research 
to study normal elderly subjects 
and THR patients 
to provide further insight to this question. 
THE 3-D WAVING PLATE MODEL: PREDICTIONS FOR FISH LOCOMOTION

The 3-D waving plate theory for incompressible potential flow past an undulating plate (Cheng et al, 
199 
1 
,J. FluidMe& 
232: 34 I ) has been applied to illuminate several aspects of fish locomotion. 1. Functional 
mornhologv of undulatinn fins: the energetic quantities for a variety of planforms and movements are calculated 
to elucidate the morphological adaptations and undulating movements of the caudal fin for carangiform fishes. 
Particularly, the lunate tail of fast ocean animals is found to reach almost optimum perfotmance and shows a 
compromise between highest efficiencies and sufficient thrust coefficients. 2. Dvnamics of swimminn and 
timina of muscle contraction: the bending moments along the fish body produced by muscle activation are 
calculated for a fast swimming saithe and an assumed eel-like swimmer. The phase relationship between 
muscle activity and curvature are close to those from the EMG measurements. The phase difference between 
activation and movement does change only up to a quarter cycle for the carangiform swimmer and changes 
greatly close to one cycle from out of phase, then in phase to out ofphase again for the anguilliform swimmer. 
3. Enernv storage bv elastic mechanisms in cetacean tail: We reevaluated this question by expanding Bennet et 
al. -s (1987, J. Zool., Land 2 11: 177) model using a more realistic representation of the hydrodynamic forces. 
We found that the elastic tissues in the body of cetaceans 
significantly reduce metabotic cost of locomotion, and 
the elastic tissues in cetaceans 
have the right properties to provide for almost maximum savings possible (ca. 50 
%). 4. Movement and efficiencv: The elongated body theory is studied to suggest that a term containing the 
envelope slope of the undulating amplitude near the tail end in the theory should be included in the estimation of 
propulsive performance for fish swimming with variable amplitude.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the trabecular bone density of the proximal scsamoid bones (PSB) 
in Thoroughbred horses as it relates to fractures based on quantitative computed tomographic (CT) data. Two 
millimeter transverse GT slices of the PSB of a 16 and 18 year old mares and two untrained yearlings were 
obtained and processed at a resolution of 256 by 256 pixels. Average CT numbers of the pixels on each image 
slice were calculated for each PSB and were normalized as percent length of the long axis of the bone (0% = 
apex; 100% base). Comparisons of the average CT numbersbetween the fore- and hind limbs were made at 
30 and 100 percent bone length, which represented the locations where apical and basal fractures occurred 
respectively~ Average CT ntibers 
at the-apical and basal regions of the-PSB appeared to be lower than that at 
the mid-section. The decreases 
of bone densitv in the a&al and basal regions of the PSB mav imnlv intrinsic 
weakness that is related to its fracture. Results also sho;ved that apical a& mid-section CT t&m&& 
of the 
PSB in the hind limbs were higher than that in the forelimbs (P c 0.05) but the difference was not significant 
(P > 0.05) in the basal region. These findings supported clinical observations that fractures of the PSB mostly 
occurred in the forelimbs but did not support clinical data that basal fractures were more common than apicat 
fractures in the forelimbs. This may rather be due to the excess amount of bending a@ shear stresses 
imposed 
in the basal region of the PSB as the congruity of the artictdar surfaces between the basal aspect of the PSB 
and the palmar aspect of the third metacarpal bone decreases 
while the animal is running at extreme high 
speed. It may also result from the fact that equine forelimbs bear higher forces than the hind limbs.

may prevent (or perhaps 
promote) implant loosening in patients undergoing a total hip replacement. The 
purpose 
of this study was to understand 
how the torques at the hip are affected by foot position. We studied 12 normal 
healthy adults with a mean age of 27 while they performed 3 walking trials each of normal walking, walking with their 
right foot externally rotated approximately 45’ and walking with their right foot internally rotated approximately 45’. 
Displacement and force plate data -were 
coilected simultaneously and resultant 
joint torques at the right hip were derived 
using GaitLab software developed 
by Vaughan et al. (1992). All results in this study are for the right hip joint. The inter- 
subject 
torques 
produced 
during normal walking exhibited very repeatable 
patterns 
for torque production in all three 
planes. 
When walking with the foot internally rotated no significant differences were found when comparing the torques to those 
produced 
during normal walking. When walking with the foot externally rotated 
no significant differences, when compared 
with normal walking, were found for flexion/extension or abductiotiadduction torque production. Upon examination of 
the individual internal/external torque curves, 11 out of 12 subjects 
produced a decreased 
external rotation torque during 
mid- to terminal stance 
when the right foot was externally rotated. We performed an analysis of variance and Tukey’s 
multiple comparison procedure, which proved this difference to be significant with a p value of less than .05. It may be 
that aseptic 
loosening in THR occurs through high torsional loads 
and this decrease 
in external torque production suggests 
a possible strategy that could be employed to reduce 
torsional loading at the hip joint. It is our intention to extend this 
research 
to study normal elderly subjects 
and THR patients 
to provide further insight to this question. 
THE 3-D WAVING PLATE MODEL: PREDICTIONS FOR FISH LOCOMOTION 
J-Y. Cheng, R. Blickhan and W. Nachtigall

The 3-D waving plate theory for incompressible potential flow past an undulating plate (Cheng et al, 
199 
1 
,J. FluidMe& 
232: 34 I ) has been applied to illuminate several aspects of fish locomotion. 1. Functional 
mornhologv of undulatinn fins: the energetic quantities for a variety of planforms and movements are calculated 
to elucidate the morphological adaptations and undulating movements of the caudal fin for carangiform fishes. 
Particularly, the lunate tail of fast ocean animals is found to reach almost optimum perfotmance and shows a 
compromise between highest efficiencies and sufficient thrust coefficients. 2. Dvnamics of swimminn and 
timina of muscle contraction: the bending moments along the fish body produced by muscle activation are 
calculated for a fast swimming saithe and an assumed eel-like swimmer. The phase relationship between 
muscle activity and curvature are close to those from the EMG measurements. The phase difference between 
activation and movement does change only up to a quarter cycle for the carangiform swimmer and changes 
greatly close to one cycle from out of phase, then in phase to out ofphase again for the anguilliform swimmer. 
3. Enernv storage bv elastic mechanisms in cetacean tail: We reevaluated this question by expanding Bennet et 
al. -s (1987, J. Zool., Land 2 11: 177) model using a more realistic representation of the hydrodynamic forces. 
We found that the elastic tissues in the body of cetaceans 
significantly reduce metabotic cost of locomotion, and 
the elastic tissues in cetaceans 
have the right properties to provide for almost maximum savings possible (ca. 50 
%). 4. Movement and efficiencv: The elongated body theory is studied to suggest that a term containing the 
envelope slope of the undulating amplitude near the tail end in the theory should be included in the estimation of 
propulsive performance for fish swimming with variable amplitude. 
A QUANTITATIVE 
STUDY OF THE PROXIMAL SESAMOID BONES IN THOROUGHBRED 
HORSES 
USING COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY

Lexington, KY 40546-0099, U.S.A. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the trabecular bone density of the proximal scsamoid bones (PSB) 
in Thoroughbred horses as it relates to fractures based on quantitative computed tomographic (CT) data. Two 
millimeter transverse GT slices of the PSB of a 16 and 18 year old mares and two untrained yearlings were 
obtained and processed at a resolution of 256 by 256 pixels. Average CT numbers of the pixels on each image 
slice were calculated for each PSB and were normalized as percent length of the long axis of the bone (0% = 
apex; 100% base). Comparisons of the average CT numbersbetween the fore- and hind limbs were made at 
30 and 100 percent bone length, which represented the locations where apical and basal fractures occurred 
respectively~ Average CT ntibers 
at the-apical and basal regions of the-PSB appeared to be lower than that at 
the mid-section. The decreases 
of bone densitv in the a&al and basal regions of the PSB mav imnlv intrinsic 
weakness that is related to its fracture. Results also sho;ved that apical a& mid-section CT t&m&& 
of the 
PSB in the hind limbs were higher than that in the forelimbs (P c 0.05) but the difference was not significant 
(P > 0.05) in the basal region. These findings supported clinical observations that fractures of the PSB mostly 
occurred in the forelimbs but did not support clinical data that basal fractures were more common than apicat 
fractures in the forelimbs. This may rather be due to the excess amount of bending a@ shear stresses 
imposed 
in the basal region of the PSB as the congruity of the artictdar surfaces between the basal aspect of the PSB 
and the palmar aspect of the third metacarpal bone decreases 
while the animal is running at extreme high 
speed. It may also result from the fact that equine forelimbs bear higher forces than the hind limbs.

Our aims were 
to

were 
altered 
after 
six

The horses 
were 
exercised 
twice 
daily 
on a low intensity 
horse-walker 
and 
thrice 
weekly 
on a high

Circular 
markers 
were placed 
over 
the 
approximate 
centres 
of

The

The results 
showed stride 
frequencies 
and lengths 
were unaltered 
but 
stance 
phases 
were significantly 
reduced. 
Changes 
in 
the 
horizontal-axis 
were 
less 
uniform 
than 
in 
the 
vertical-axis. 
Training 
altered 
the 
horses' 
motion 
so that 
greater 
distal 
limb 
lift 
was achieved 
within 
the 
same stride 
duration, 
due 
to 
small, 
significant 
increases 
in 
vertical 
lift 
of 
the 
carpal 
and fetlock 
joints, 
resulting 
in 
a higher 
hoof

The adaptatipns 
are 
believed 
to 
result 
in more mechanically

motion 
at all 
speeds.

Positional 
information 
is 
not 
well 
documented 
and is 
necessary 
for 
valid 
comparison 
of different 
horse's 
responses 
to training. 
Our aims were 
to 
determine 
which 
temporal 
and 
positional 
parameters 
of 
the 
limb 
were 
altered 
after 
six 
similar 
Thoroughbred 
fillies 
had eight 
weeks of training. 
The horses 
were 
exercised 
twice 
daily 
on a low intensity 
horse-walker 
and 
thrice 
weekly 
on a high 
speed treadmill. 
Circular 
markers 
were placed 
over 
the 
approximate 
centres 
of 
rotation 
of 
the 
limb 
joints 
and the 
heels. 
The 
left 
forelimb 
was 
recorded 
with 
the 
"MacReflex" 
system 
whilst 
horses 
cantered 
at 
several 
speeds 
and 
weeks 
1 and 
8 were 
compared. 
Several 
temporal 
and 
positional 
parameters 
were 
determined 
and 
results 
were 
analysed 
using 
a matched 
pairs 
Students 
t-test. 
The results 
showed stride 
frequencies 
and lengths 
were unaltered 
but 
stance 
phases 
were significantly 
reduced. 
Changes 
in 
the 
horizontal-axis 
were 
less 
uniform 
than 
in 
the 
vertical-axis. 
Training 
altered 
the 
horses' 
motion 
so that 
greater 
distal 
limb 
lift 
was achieved 
within 
the 
same stride 
duration, 
due 
to 
small, 
significant 
increases 
in 
vertical 
lift 
of 
the 
carpal 
and fetlock 
joints, 
resulting 
in 
a higher 
hoof 
trajectory. 
The adaptatipns 
are 
believed 
to 
result 
in more mechanically 
efficient 
motion 
at all 
speeds.

Stairclimbing 
is an appealing functional activity to study since it places more stress on 
the knee than level walking. Thirty-five 
young normals were examined using a three- 
dimensional opto-electric motion tracking system and simultaneous force plate data collection. 
Flexion-extension profiles were similar for all subjects, while the adduction and rotation 
profiles were quite variable. Global forces were approximately one body weight in the vertical 
direction (Z), and roughly l/lOth of a body weight in the X and Y. If the global force data are 
translated and represented fixed to the shank the forward shear (X) force increases by a factor 
of 4 to just less than l/2 body weight. These large shear forces cannot be ignored. The flexion- 
extension moments (counter-balanced by quadriceps activity) about the knee show a large 
moment (1.00 Nm/body weight) that tends to flex the knee just after foot contact, with another 
smaller moment (0.6 Nm/body weight) near the end of stance. The adduction moment showed a 
similar profile but with a lower peak (0.3 Nm/body weight). The large differences in the global 
versus the fixed body forces are due to the orientation of the shank in the global coordinate 
system and represent a different partitioning 
of the same total force vector. This difference 
underscores the need to present forces in the fixed body system. These data can be used as 
baseline data for testing patient function after medical intervention.

To quantify the joint forces in the GlenoHurneraI 
(GH) joint during wheelchair 
propulsion, 
a simulated 
wheelchair 
push was performed 
on a wheelchair 
ergometer. 
Four subjects 
were asked 
to resist rolling backwards 
against 
five different slopes 
that represented 
0% to 40% of their maximal 
push 
force (avg. 
244+20 
N. for the right 
arrp) 
and 
their bands 
positioned 
at -15, 0, 15, 
30 and 
60”. relative 
to Top-Dead-Center 
(TDC). During each 
teat 
3D 
poshions 
of tbe upper 
extremity 
and 
trunk were. 
optically 
determined. 
The 
orientation 
of tbe scapula 
was 
measured 
by 
direct 
digitization. 
External 
forces 
were 
measured 
on tbe rim and 
axle 
of tbe ergometer. 
Measured 
data 
were 
used 
as 
input 
for a 3D computer 
model 
of the 
human 
shoulder 
(Van 
der 
Helm, 
1991). 
Data for three 
subjects 
were 
available. 
Not alI conditions 
could be used 
for calculation. 
For three 
cases 
(all 
40%), 
the model 
could not find a solution, 
despite 
an upscaled 
PCSA 
value 
for the model 
muscles 
to 100 N.c&. 
Results 
indicated 
joint forces 
of up to 200 N.m, 
and 
approximately 
ten 
times 
as 
bigb as 
the 
net forces. 
The 
joint fOKx?S 
in the 
0 and 
1.5” 
positions 
were 
significantly 
higher 
than 
those 
in tbe 
60 degrees 
position. 
It is assumed 
that 
the 
higher 
joint forces 
in those 
positions 
are 
related 
to the 
larger 
instability 
of the GH joint in those 
positions. 
The results 
seem 
to indicate 
that 
high forces 
contribute 
to the 
high 
incidence 
of GH complaints 
in wheelchair 
users.

Most of the technics 
used 
to analyse 
horses 
gaits needs 
infrastructure 
(force plate, 
wire) or a long treatment 
of data (cinematographics 
technics). In order to realise a horse simulator (named PERSIVAL) able to 
reproduce 
the movements 
of the saddle 
corresponding 
to the actions 
of the horse 
within the different gaits, we 
used accelerometrical 
technics to record the trajectory of the saddle. 
The measurements 
are taken by an 
accelerometrical 
exchange 
made 
up of 6 accelerometers 
set out according 
the 3 axis X,Y,Z and attach to the 
front of the saddle. 
With this exchange 
we accede 
to the 6 degrees 
of freedom of the space 
movement.

Recent 
investigations 
into the 
distribution of subchondral 
mineralisation 
suggest 
that the trochlear 
notch 
deviates 
in its central part from an 
exact 
fit with the humeral 
condylus 
and 
pressure 
is rather 
transmitted 
through 
one 
ventral and 
one 
dorsal 
route than 
centrally. We therefore 
examined 
16 specimens 
of formalin fixed humero- 
ulnar 
joints to quantify the amount 
of inconcruity in between 
the 
two joint components. 
Polyether 
impression 
material 
was 
used 
to prepare 
casts 
of the 
joint cavity under 
loads 
between 
20 and 1280 
N using a Zwick material 
testing 
machine. 
In specimens 
with divided articular surfaces 
the 
joint components 
come 
into contact 
only ven- 
trally and 
dorsally in the 
joint under 
a load of 20 N. In the 
deepest 
part of the trochlear 
notch the 
joint space 
is 
about lmm wide in the 
centre 
and 
up to 3mm at the media1 
and 
lateral 
edges 
of the 
articular surface Under 
in- 
creasing 
loads 
the 
joint space 
narrows 
and 
the contact 
areas 
run together 
centrally, leaving only a 
joint space 
of 
about lnun at both edges. 
Specimens 
with continous 
articular cartilage 
show 
a lower degree 
of incongruity, 
amountmg 
to 0.5 mm m the centre 
of the 
joint. These 
findings confirm earlier observations 
that in sagittal 
set- 
tions 
through 
the humero-ulnar 
joint the 
trochiear 
notch 
is somewhat 
deeper 
than 
it should 
be for a perfect 
fit 
with the trochlea. 
The results 
show, 
however, 
that the amount 
of incongruity between 
the 
joint-components 
de- 
pends 
on the position of the sagittal 
section 
within the 
joint surface 
and 
on the surface 
morphlogy of the 
trochlear 
notch. 
Our results 
cansatisfactorily explain the behaviour 
of the humero-ulnar 
contact 
areas 
and 
can 
plausibly 
account 
for an adaptation 
of the subchondral 
bone 
to a 
peripheral 
transmission 
of load. It is suggested 
that this 
leads 
optimal stress 
distribution wheo the 
joint is loaded 
and 
to a better 
nourishment 
of the articular cartilage.

To quantify the joint forces in the GlenoHurneraI 
(GH) joint during wheelchair 
propulsion, 
a simulated 
wheelchair 
push was performed 
on a wheelchair 
ergometer. 
Four subjects 
were asked 
to resist rolling backwards 
against 
five different slopes 
that represented 
0% to 40% of their maximal 
push 
force (avg. 
244+20 
N. for the right 
arrp) 
and 
their bands 
positioned 
at -15, 0, 15, 
30 and 
60”. relative 
to Top-Dead-Center 
(TDC). During each 
teat 
3D 
poshions 
of tbe upper 
extremity 
and 
trunk were. 
optically 
determined. 
The 
orientation 
of tbe scapula 
was 
measured 
by 
direct 
digitization. 
External 
forces 
were 
measured 
on tbe rim and 
axle 
of tbe ergometer. 
Measured 
data 
were 
used 
as 
input 
for a 3D computer 
model 
of the 
human 
shoulder 
(Van 
der 
Helm, 
1991). 
Data for three 
subjects 
were 
available. 
Not alI conditions 
could be used 
for calculation. 
For three 
cases 
(all 
40%), 
the model 
could not find a solution, 
despite 
an upscaled 
PCSA 
value 
for the model 
muscles 
to 100 N.c&. 
Results 
indicated 
joint forces 
of up to 200 N.m, 
and 
approximately 
ten 
times 
as 
bigb as 
the 
net forces. 
The 
joint fOKx?S 
in the 
0 and 
1.5” 
positions 
were 
significantly 
higher 
than 
those 
in tbe 
60 degrees 
position. 
It is assumed 
that 
the 
higher 
joint forces 
in those 
positions 
are 
related 
to the 
larger 
instability 
of the GH joint in those 
positions. 
The results 
seem 
to indicate

high forces 
contribute 
to the 
high

Most of the technics 
used 
to analyse 
horses 
gaits needs 
infrastructure 
(force plate, 
wire) or a long treatment 
of data (cinematographics 
technics). In order to realise a horse simulator (named PERSIVAL) able to 
reproduce 
the movements 
of the saddle 
corresponding 
to the actions 
of the horse 
within the different gaits, we 
used accelerometrical 
technics to record the trajectory of the saddle. 
The measurements 
are taken by an 
accelerometrical 
exchange 
made 
up of 6 accelerometers 
set out according 
the 3 axis X,Y,Z and attach to the 
front of the saddle. 
With this exchange

LOAD DISTRIBUTION IN THE HUMAN ELBOW-JOINT: 
ASSESSMENT 
OF SUBCHONDRAL MINERALISATION BY CT OSTEOABSORPTIOMETRY 
AND HUMERO-ULNAR CONTACT AREAS BY POLYETHER CASTING

The elbow-joint is subjected 
to surprisingly high loads 
during everyday 
use. 
These 
my lead 
to secondary 
osteoarthritis 
and 
play an important 
part in mechanical 
failure of elbow 
joint arthroplasty. 
We therefore 
exami- 
ned 
the 
distribution of subchondral 
mineralisation 
in 21 specimens 
of the 
elbow-joint using CT-osteoabsorptio- 
metry and 
investigated 
humero-ulnar 
contact 
areas 
by means 
of polyether 
casting 
material. 
The highest 
degree 
of 
mineralisation 
is usually found in the medial 
part of the 
joint. This means 
that on average 
more stress 
is transmit- 
ted through 
the 
humeroulnar 
joint. Within the humeroradial 
part the 
desity maxima 
are 
always 
located 
in the 
cen- 
tre. 
The central 
part of the humero-ulnar 
joint on the 
other hand 
is often poorly mineralised 
with density 
maxima 
appearing 
rather 
in the anterior 
and 
posterior 
aspects 
of the 
joint surface. 
These 
density 
patterns 
suggest 
central 
pressure 
transmission 
in the humeroradial 
part, 
due 
to the 
joint components 
being 
congrous. 
In the humero-ulnar 
part, 
however, 
due to physiological incongruity the 
joint force is transmitted 
rather 
peripherally through 
an ante- 
rior and 
posterior 
route. 
The peripheral 
contact 
areas 
in the anterior 
and 
posterior 
part of the humero-ulnar 
joint 
found with lower loads 
clearly support 
the 
concept 
of such 
a primary incongruence. 
It is only under 
higher 
forces

To study the hydrostatic behaviour 
of the lumbar nucleus 
pulposus, 
the intranuclear 
pressure 
was 
measured 
simultaneously at two different points of the same 
intervertebral disc using cadavers, 
lumbar 
functional units. and isolated nuclear 
material for a discrete 
sinusoidal 
vibration of 1. 2 or 5 mm amnlitude 
and 
a frequency 
ranging from 3 to 15 
Hz. The pressure 
transducers 
were 
distant 
of about 10 
mm in cadavers 
and 
formed an angle 
of 60” approximatively, while they formed an angle 
of 180“ in the lumbar functional 
units and the isolated nuclear material. The two measurements 
were compared 
using a simple regression 
analysis following a linear model and the test of Wilcoxon. The measured 
intranuclear pressure 
was 
compared 
to the 
computed 
one (P,=F/S) in static 
and 
in dynamic in the case 
of the isolated 
nuclear 
material. 
No differences, 
in static or in dynamic, were observed 
between 
the two pressure 
measurements 
in 
all cases. 
We could not have such 
results if the nucleus 
pulposus 
behaviour were not hydrostatic, else we 
should have measured 
stresses 
depending 
on the direction of the sensitive membrane, 
the position of the 
transducers 
and the flexion or the extension 
of the specimen. 
The measured 
intranuclear 
pressure 
from the 
isolated nuclear material was directly proportional to the applied force and was equal to the computed 
intranuclear 
pressure.

The helical axis surface (HAS) of the knee was evaluated under differing joint situations by means of 2 methods, 
with respect to consistency and reproducibility of the results. The finite helical axes (FHA) were determined 1) 
directly by means of an axiometer providing the intersection points of the FHA with tbe medial and lateral axiometer 
planes, and 2) mathematically 
by means of 3D-data provided by a 3D digitizer (Polhemus Isotrak@). The 
experimentsI situations of the knees were: I) an unloaded state, 
2) stmssed 
state (external moment of 125 Nm tending 
to flex, counteracted by the patellar ligament, 3) stressed state with severed anterior cruciate ligament, and 4) 
hyperextension/-flexion stress. 
The HASs were determined relative to femur and tibia. All HASs were reproducible 
within trial-repeats. The HAS is rather constant from knee to knee, showing some individual variability. Relative to 
the femur, the FHA runs from mediopmximal to latemdistal in extension. This obIiquity is caused by the “automatic 
rotation”. In the course of flexion, the FHA at first migrates distally on the medial side, then posteriorly and slightly

The elbow-joint is subjected 
to surprisingly high loads 
during everyday 
use. 
These 
my lead 
to secondary 
osteoarthritis 
and 
play an important 
part in mechanical 
failure of elbow 
joint arthroplasty. 
We therefore 
exami- 
ned 
the 
distribution of subchondral 
mineralisation 
in 21 specimens 
of the 
elbow-joint using CT-osteoabsorptio- 
metry and 
investigated 
humero-ulnar 
contact 
areas 
by means 
of polyether 
casting 
material. 
The highest 
degree 
of 
mineralisation 
is usually found in the medial 
part of the 
joint. This means 
that on average 
more stress 
is transmit- 
ted through 
the 
humeroulnar 
joint. Within the humeroradial 
part the 
desity maxima 
are 
always 
located 
in the 
cen- 
tre. 
The central 
part of the humero-ulnar 
joint on the 
other hand 
is often poorly mineralised 
with density 
maxima 
appearing 
rather 
in the anterior 
and 
posterior 
aspects 
of the 
joint surface. 
These 
density 
patterns 
suggest 
central 
pressure 
transmission 
in the humeroradial 
part, 
due 
to the 
joint components 
being 
congrous. 
In the humero-ulnar 
part, 
however, 
due to physiological incongruity the 
joint force is transmitted 
rather 
peripherally through 
an ante- 
rior and 
posterior 
route. 
The peripheral 
contact 
areas 
in the anterior 
and 
posterior 
part of the humero-ulnar 
joint 
found with lower loads 
clearly support 
the 
concept 
of such 
a primary incongruence. 
It is only under 
higher 
forces 
that the 
contact 
areas 
run together 
in the 
joint centre, 
probably 
due 
to viscoelastic 
deformation 
of the articular

MEASUREMENTS 
OF VERTEBRAL 
MOVEMENTS 
IN UNEMBALMED 
HUMAN CADAVERS USING 
BONE PINS, SURFACE MARKERS AND ACCELEROMETERS. 
Julianna Gal, Walter Herzog, Gregory Kawchuk, Philip Conway and Yuan-Ting Zhang, 
Human Performance Laboratory, Faculty of Physical Education, University of Calgary, Canada, T2N 1

High speed cinematography was used to record the movements of stainless steel bone pins embedded 
in the vertebral bodies of Tl 0, Tl 1, and T12 during posterior-anterior 
thrusts to the right transverse 
process of Tl 1 in two unembalmed post-rigor male cadavers. Five degrees of freedom were calculated: 
posterior-anterior 
(p-a) translation, 
axial rotation, sagittal 
rotation, 
lateral translation, 
and axial 
translation. 
Ranges of relative movements 
between TlO,Tl 1 and Tll ,T12 were greatest in p-a 
translation, axial rotation, and saglttal rotation (0.4-3.3 mm and 0.4-3.2 mm (a.4 mm); 0.4-l .9 deg. and 
0.0-1.9 deg. (f0.3 deg.): and 0.2-6.5 deg. and 0.7-3.4 deg. (5to.3 deg.), respectively). 
The ranges of 
relative p-a translation and axial rotation exceeded normal clinical ranges of motion for comparable 
functional spinal units. P-a translations were also estimated non-invasively by taping surface markers 
and uni-axial accelerometers to the skin over the spinous processes of Tl 0, Tl 1, and T12. Movements 
of the surface markers were digitized from the films to yield p-a translations. 
P-a accelerations, derived 
from the accelerometers, were doubly-integrated to give p-a translations. 
The p-a translations of the 
surface markers more accurately reflected the p-a translations of the embedded bone pins, than did 
those displacements 
derived from the accelerometers. 
The latter typically underestimated the values 
obtained using the bone pins. These underestimates may have been related to the vertebral rotations 
that accompanied 
the translations, 
because axial and sagittal rotations would tend to reduce the 
acceleration measured in the p-a direction.

The comparison 
between 
small 
mammals and lizards 
emphasizes 
that 
during 
fast 
gaits, 
althought 
the basic 
geometrical 
pattern 
of the 
hind 
limbs 
is 
identical 
the use of the 
successive 
segments 
is 
different 
in mammals and reptiles, 
in relation 
to the different 
dominant 
orientation 
of the vertebral 
mobility. 
This 
suggests 
the 
evolution 
toward 
two 
bipedal 
modes: 
a synchronous 
action 
in bipedal 
hopping 
for 
mammals and an alternate 
action 
in bipedal 
run 
for 
reptiles. 
In both 
cases, 
this 
term 
is reached 
throught 
an 
asymmetrical 
phase. 
QUANTIFICATION 
OF THREE DIMENSIONAL 
PASSIVE CIRCUMDUCTION 
OF THE 
GLENOHUMERAL 
JOINT (A CADAVERIC STUDY) 
P. Genoud and P. Hoffmeyer 
Iaboratoire de Cin&ologie, Clinique d’Orthop6die 
H6pital Cantonal 
Universitaire de Get&e, Switzerland 
Using a magnetic tracking system (3Spac.e 
TM Tracker System, Polhemus & Co), we have quantified the 
movement of the proximal humerus against the glenoid in 10 cadaveric specimens. 
Anterior and posterior passive 
circumductions (a total of 59, manually produced 
using a nylon loop about the humeral shaft to minimize. 
friction) were 
recorded 
at 10 [Hz]. An xy’x” Euler sequence 
was used to describe 
the angular motion of the humerus relative to the 
scapula 
and was expressed 
in terms of plane of elevation 4, elevation 0 and axial rotation v (An et al 1991). All ten 
shoulder 
specimens 
exhibited similar behavior for the 6 = B(4) curves in both anterior and posterior direction. During 
each 
circumduction an automatic external rotation (\yzo) occurred, 
which was strongly dependent 
on the direction of the 
circumduction. The maximum value of the external 
rotation was always observed 
in a plane 
posterior to the plane 
of the 
scapula. 
The differences in the curves yr = ~(4) for anterior and posterior circumductions can be probably explained 
both by the particulars of the skeletal 
structure of the glenohumeral 
joint (a shallow glenoid against 
a near 
hemispherical 
hurneral head, the influence of the coraco-acromial arch and the tuberosities) and by the asymmetrical anatomical 
disposition of the capsuloligamentous 
elements. 
This study demonstrates 
and quantifies the movements 
associated 
with 
passive circumductions, keeping in mind that a better understanding of the three dimensional kinematics of the 
glenohumeral 
joint will have major implications in prosthetic design, surgical procedures, 
rehabilitation and athletic

High speed cinematography was used to record the movements of stainless steel bone pins embedded 
in the vertebral bodies of Tl 0, Tl 1, and T12 during posterior-anterior 
thrusts to the right transverse 
process of Tl 1 in two unembalmed post-rigor male cadavers. Five degrees of freedom were calculated: 
posterior-anterior 
(p-a) translation, 
axial rotation, sagittal 
rotation, 
lateral translation, 
and axial 
translation. 
Ranges of relative movements 
between TlO,Tl 1 and Tll ,T12 were greatest in p-a 
translation, axial rotation, and saglttal rotation (0.4-3.3 mm and 0.4-3.2 mm (a.4 mm); 0.4-l .9 deg. and 
0.0-1.9 deg. (f0.3 deg.): and 0.2-6.5 deg. and 0.7-3.4 deg. (5to.3 deg.), respectively). 
The ranges of 
relative p-a translation and axial rotation exceeded normal clinical ranges of motion for comparable 
functional spinal units. P-a translations were also estimated non-invasively by taping surface markers 
and uni-axial accelerometers to the skin over the spinous processes of Tl 0, Tl 1, and T12. Movements 
of the surface markers were digitized from the films to yield p-a translations. 
P-a accelerations, derived 
from the accelerometers, were doubly-integrated to give p-a translations. 
The p-a translations of the 
surface markers more accurately reflected the p-a translations of the embedded bone pins, than did 
those displacements 
derived from the accelerometers. 
The latter typically underestimated the values 
obtained using the bone pins. These underestimates may have been related to the vertebral rotations 
that accompanied 
the translations, 
because axial and sagittal rotations would tend to reduce the 
acceleration measured in the p-a direction.

QUANTIFICATION 
OF THREE DIMENSIONAL 
PASSIVE CIRCUMDUCTION

Using a magnetic tracking system (3Spac.e 
TM Tracker System, Polhemus & Co), we have quantified the 
movement of the proximal humerus against the glenoid in 10 cadaveric specimens. 
Anterior and posterior passive 
circumductions (a total of 59, manually produced 
using a nylon loop about the humeral shaft to minimize. 
friction) were 
recorded 
at 10 [Hz]. An xy’x” Euler sequence 
was used to describe 
the angular motion of the humerus relative to the 
scapula 
and was expressed 
in terms of plane of elevation 4, elevation 0 and axial rotation v (An et al 1991). All ten 
shoulder 
specimens 
exhibited similar behavior for the 6 = B(4) curves in both anterior and posterior direction. During 
each 
circumduction an automatic external rotation (\yzo) occurred, 
which was strongly dependent 
on the direction of the 
circumduction. The maximum value of the external 
rotation was always observed 
in a plane 
posterior to the plane 
of the 
scapula. 
The differences in the curves yr = ~(4) for anterior and posterior circumductions can be probably explained 
both by the particulars of the skeletal 
structure of the glenohumeral 
joint (a shallow glenoid against 
a near 
hemispherical 
hurneral head, the influence of the coraco-acromial arch and the tuberosities) and by the asymmetrical anatomical 
disposition of the capsuloligamentous 
elements. 
This study demonstrates 
and quantifies the movements 
associated 
with 
passive circumductions, keeping in mind that a better understanding of the three dimensional kinematics of the 
glenohumeral 
joint will have major implications in prosthetic design, surgical procedures, 
rehabilitation and athletic 
training programs.

A BI-ARTICULATING TWO DIMENSIONAL COMPUTER MODEL OF THE HUMAN PATELLO-FEMORAL

A bi-articulating two dimensional 
computer model of tbe human patella has been 
developed. 
The associated 
model of the 
tibio-femoral joint is based 
on the four-bar linkage formed by the ACl, PCL. and their attachments 
on the tibia and femur, 
accounting 
thus for the rolling movements 
of the femur on the tibia during flexion/extension. 
The bi-articulating nature of 
the model reproduces 
the shift of patellar contact with the femur, from the trochlear groove at low flexion angles to the 
femoral condyles 
at high flexion. The position of the contact 
point is detemdned 
by the equilibrium condition that the line of 
action of the patello-femoral force must pass through the intersection 
of the line3 of action of the forces in the quadriceps 
and patellar tendons. Since that intersection moves proximally during flexion, as demonstrated 
by Goodfellow et al 
(1976,JBJS58-B,283-7), 
the contact 
point on the 
patella also 
moves 
proximally during flexion. 
The effects of parameter 
variation can be modelled. 
The model demonstrates 
that to keep contact between 
the poles of the. 
patella, there 
is a limit to the 
permissible advancement 
of the tibial tuberosity, 
as 
in the Maquet procedure. 
There is a similar 
limit to the 
permissible 
patellar thickness 
after 
knee 
replacement. 
For one 
typical parameter 
set 
at full extension, 
these 
limits 
were 15mm for the advancement 
of the tibial tuberosity and 1.4mm for the thickness of the patella. Advancement 
of the 
tuberosity 
by 1Omm 
diminished the calculated 
patello-femoral contact 
force by 19.5% 
at 50” flexion angle.

the mean values

magnitudes 
of foot-floor 
reaction 
forces 
at both 
stances, 
during 
the human gait,

of 60 adults 
(aged 
17-22), 
a half 
male and a 
half 
female, 
with 
no apparent 
pathology, 
to observe 
if 
gait 
patterns 
were similar 
in both 
groups. 
They walked 
at self-selected 
normal 
speed 
(children,

s.d.=0.352 
m/s; 
adults, 
?=1.152, 
s.d.=0.157 
m/s) 
on a gait 
walkway 
with 
two standard 
extensiometric 
force 
platforms. 
The forces 
registered 
were standardized 
to body weight 
and analyzed 
statisti- 
cally. 
The means of each variable 
were compared 
between 
the 
two groups 
with 
Welch's 
test 
(t separate), 
for 
the variances 
were found 
not 
to be equal 
with 
Snedecor's 
F-test, 
being 
higher 
in children. 
The mean gait 
speed was higher 
in adults 
(pcO.001). 
Since 
the 
indivi- 
duals 
walked 
at self-selected 
gait 
speed, 
this 
parameter 
was not 
considered. 
Peak antero- 
posterior 
forces 
standardized 
to weight 
were greater 
in children, 
excepting 
the right 
bra- 
king 
force. 
Transversal 
forces 
were also 
greater 
in children, 
excepting 
the 
right 
peak 
medial 
force. 
Vertical 
peak forces 
were first 
stable 
in children, 
reaching 
the adult 
pattern 
before 
the 
other 
forces. 
Only the 
first 
vertical 
peak force, 
at the 
left 
heel- 
stike, 
was greater 
in children. 
The present 
study 
shows that 
at the age of 
5-6 the 
adult 
kinetic 
gait 
pattern 
is not 
consolidated, 
the most of transversal 
and antero-posterior 
forces 
being 
significantly 
different 
between 
the 
two groups. 
However, 
vertical 
forces 
show a similar 
behaviollr.

This 
study 
was undertaken 
with 
the 
aim of analyzing 
the kinetic 
behaviour 
of both 
feet 
in 30 young men, aged between 
17 and 22, with 
no apparent 
locomotive 
pathology, 
at 
different 
gait 
speeds 
(self-selected 
slow, 
normal 
and fast 
speeds), 
using 
two extensio- 
metric 
force 
platforms. 
An ANOVA was made to observe 
if 
the kinetic 
variables 
changed 
with 
gait 
speed, 
using 
Newman-Keuls 
test 
for 
multiple 
paired 
comparison 
(fast-slow, 
fast- 
normal, 
normal-slow). 
The test 
for 
analysis 
of variance 
resulted 
in significant 
variables 
for 
all 
the parameters 
considered, 
except 
for 
the 
left 
second 
vertical 
peak force. 
A rise 
was shown in the magnitudes 
of the 
first 
vertical 
peak force 
when the 
speed rose, 
a fact 
reported 
in the 
literature. 
But speeds 
lower 
than 
normal 
did 
not 
show statistical 
differences 
from this. 
The second 
vertical 
peak force 
was more 
irregular 
than 
the 
first 
one regarding 
speed. 
During 
the 
right 
stance 
we found 
statistically 
significant 
differen- 
ces between 
normal 
and slow speeds, 
and between 
slow 
and fast. 
For the 
left 
side 
we could 
not 
detect 
differences 
among the 
three 
speeds. 
The valley 
force 
fell 
off 
as the 
speed 
rose, 
in line 
with 
the 
literature. 
The peak magnitude 
of the anterior 
or braking 
forces 
increased 
significantly 
with 
the 
speed in all 
both 
stances 
as reported 
in the 
literature, 
but 
the peak posterior 
or propulsive 
force 
only 
increased 
significantly 
between 
very 
different 
gait 
speeds. 
Propulsive 
forces 
were less 
sensitive 
to speed than 
braking 
forces. 
The peak medio-lateral 
forces 
were the most irregular 
regarding 
speed and usually 
rose 
with 
it.

A BI-ARTICULATING TWO DIMENSIONAL COMPUTER MODEL OF THE HUMAN PATELLO-FEMORAL 
JOINT

A bi-articulating two dimensional 
computer model of tbe human patella has been 
developed. 
The associated 
model of the 
tibio-femoral joint is based 
on the four-bar linkage formed by the ACl, PCL. and their attachments 
on the tibia and femur, 
accounting 
thus for the rolling movements 
of the femur on the tibia during flexion/extension. 
The bi-articulating nature of 
the model reproduces 
the shift of patellar contact with the femur, from the trochlear groove at low flexion angles to the 
femoral condyles 
at high flexion. The position of the contact 
point is detemdned 
by the equilibrium condition that the line of 
action of the patello-femoral force must pass through the intersection 
of the line3 of action of the forces in the quadriceps 
and patellar tendons. Since that intersection moves proximally during flexion, as demonstrated 
by Goodfellow et al 
(1976,JBJS58-B,283-7), 
the contact 
point on the 
patella also 
moves 
proximally during flexion. 
The effects of parameter 
variation can be modelled. 
The model demonstrates 
that to keep contact between 
the poles of the. 
patella, there 
is a limit to the 
permissible advancement 
of the tibial tuberosity, 
as 
in the Maquet procedure. 
There is a similar 
limit to the 
permissible 
patellar thickness 
after 
knee 
replacement. 
For one 
typical parameter 
set 
at full extension, 
these 
limits 
were 15mm for the advancement 
of the tibial tuberosity and 1.4mm for the thickness of the patella. Advancement 
of the 
tuberosity 
by 1Omm 
diminished the calculated 
patello-femoral contact 
force by 19.5% 
at 50” flexion angle.

17-22), 
a half

LUMBAR SPINE MOTION IN THE SAGITTAL PLANE

The damping behaviour of the spine depends on the geometry of the spine. Therefore the position of 
the pelvic ring, the caudal attachment of the spine is very important, as it detenines 
the degree of lordosis. 
The purpose of this study was to document the mechanical behaviour of the lumbar spine under axial load 
for different angles of the pelvis. The displacement of the measured vertebrae in the horizontal and vertical 
plane under static load gives us basic information needed to discuss reactions under dynamic load. 
4 fresh male specimens (Pelvis-Thl i) were dissected of all nonligamentous soft tissue. The age was 
58, 61, 62 and 63 years. The pelvis was mounted in epoxy in a neutral position. The specimen with markers 
attached was placed in a servo hydraulic testing machine. Displacement transducers were installed to 
measure the shift of the vertebrae L5. L4, L2 and Ll. Axial load was applied in three defined positions, 
neutral position, reclination with hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine (-6”) and inclination of the lumbar spine 
with relative kyphosis (+6”). The loading plate was attached to the cranial endplate of Thll, 
perpendicular to 
the z- axis, the longitudinal axe of the spine.

In doing exercise as well as in hole day positions the spine is highly stressed. Mathematical models 
of the spine are often used to describe the biomechanics of pathologic curves. We want to discuss non- 
pathologic spine curves looking for minimal stress. Therefore we developed a mathematical spine model 
heading for the optimal curve of the spine for given marginal conditions. 
We describe 
a section of the vertebral 
column 
by means of a mathematical 
model. 
In 
correspondence to normal anatomy it consists of both rigid elements (the vertebral bodies) and flexible 
elements (the elastic intervertebral discs). For the given limits (i.e. the position and inclination of the most 
cephalad and caudal vertebra) the ideal shape of the vertebral columns is computed by minimising the 
individual segmental stress. 
The vertebral bodies are taken to be rigid, the intervertebral discs are assumed to be flexible. The z- 
axis of our coordinate system is oriented caudally, the unit of length is taken as the mean distance of 
adjacent vertebral bodies. In every movement the vertebral discs are compressed on one side and distract at 
the other. In between lays a neutral zone, called the neutral fibre. Our optimisation principle is based upon 
minimising local forces. Strain forces relevant to the vertebral column can be assessed by means of this 
mathematical model.

Contact pressures and areas of the cat patellofemoral joint were measured experimentally using 
pressure sensitive film of low and medium grade. The measurements were performed during isometric 
contractions of the knee extensor muscles produced by nerve stimulation at dltierent stimulation levels 
and at different knee angles. Patellar tendon forces were measured using a force transducer. Resultant 
contact forces were obtalned from the pressure stains. Theoretical contact forces were calculated using a 
planar model of the patella containing three external forces. The lines of action of these three forces were 
obtained using fluoroscopy, and patellar tendon force magnitudes were measured experimentally. 
Preliminary pressure measurement results for three patellar tendon force levels from one animal at one 
knee joint angle were analyzed. The comparison between measured and predicted contact forces agreed 
well for the trials performed using low grade pressure sensitive film but did not agree well when using 
medium grade film. Medium grade film, with a sensing threshold of approximately 4 MPa, was used at 
higher muscular force levels to avoid saturation of the pressure signal, thus, contact areas and pressures 
below 4 MPa were not recorded. This will result in an underestimation of the contact area. These results of 
this preliminary study suggest that accurate determination of joint contact pressures using pressure 
sensitive film may be best performed by using combined information from low, medium and possibly high 
grade film, particularly for conditions where high pressure values are expected.

MULTI COMPONENT

In doing exercise as well as in hole day positions the spine is highly stressed. Mathematical models 
of the spine are often used to describe the biomechanics of pathologic curves. We want to discuss non- 
pathologic spine curves looking for minimal stress. Therefore we developed a mathematical spine model 
heading for the optimal curve of the spine for given marginal conditions. 
We describe 
a section of the vertebral 
column 
by means of a mathematical 
model. 
In 
correspondence to normal anatomy it consists of both rigid elements (the vertebral bodies) and flexible 
elements (the elastic intervertebral discs). For the given limits (i.e. the position and inclination of the most 
cephalad and caudal vertebra) the ideal shape of the vertebral columns is computed by minimising the 
individual segmental stress. 
The vertebral bodies are taken to be rigid, the intervertebral discs are assumed to be flexible. The z- 
axis of our coordinate system is oriented caudally, the unit of length is taken as the mean distance of 
adjacent vertebral bodies. In every movement the vertebral discs are compressed on one side and distract at 
the other. In between lays a neutral zone, called the neutral fibre. Our optimisation principle is based upon 
minimising local forces. Strain forces relevant to the vertebral column can be assessed by means of this 
mathematical model.

Contact pressures and areas of the cat patellofemoral joint were measured experimentally using 
pressure sensitive film of low and medium grade. The measurements were performed during isometric 
contractions of the knee extensor muscles produced by nerve stimulation at dltierent stimulation levels 
and at different knee angles. Patellar tendon forces were measured using a force transducer. Resultant 
contact forces were obtalned from the pressure stains. Theoretical contact forces were calculated using a 
planar model of the patella containing three external forces. The lines of action of these three forces were 
obtained using fluoroscopy, and patellar tendon force magnitudes were measured experimentally. 
Preliminary pressure measurement results for three patellar tendon force levels from one animal at one 
knee joint angle were analyzed. The comparison between measured and predicted contact forces agreed 
well for the trials performed using low grade pressure sensitive film but did not agree well when using 
medium grade film. Medium grade film, with a sensing threshold of approximately 4 MPa, was used at 
higher muscular force levels to avoid saturation of the pressure signal, thus, contact areas and pressures 
below 4 MPa were not recorded. This will result in an underestimation of the contact area. These results of 
this preliminary study suggest that accurate determination of joint contact pressures using pressure 
sensitive film may be best performed by using combined information from low, medium and possibly high 
grade film, particularly for conditions where high pressure values are expected.

FORCE-SHARING 
AMONG 
CAT GASTROCNEMIUS,

MUSCLES 
DURING A FATIGUE PROTOCOL

The purpose of this study was to investigate 
possible changes in the patterns 
of force 
sharing among cat gastrocnemius 
(G), soleus( 
and plantaris 
(PI muscles during a fatigue 
protocol. 
Two male, adult cats were instrumented 
with tendon force transducers 
on G, S, and 
P, and were enticed to walk a! a nominal speed of 0-S m/s on a motor driven treadmill, 
for as 
long as they could maintain 
that pace. 
Measurements 
of muscular 
forces were obtained 
every 
two minutes for a minimum 
of ten consecutive 
steps. 
Peak forces of S tended to remain 
constant 
throughout 
the fatigue protocol, 
whereas 
peak forces of G and P tended to increase 
and decrease, 
respectively. 
S and P are small muscles compared 
to G, and P and G are fast 
fatiguing 
muscles compared 
to S. Therefore, 
forces in P may have decreased 
during the fatigue 
protocol 
because of P’s size and fatigue 
properties. 
The loss of force in P was compensated 
by 
an increase in forces of G, the strongest 
of the three muscles. 
Forces of S were relatively 
large 
from the very beginning 
of the fatigue 
protocol 
and so could not be used effectively 
to 
compensate 
for the loss of force in P with increasing 
fatigue. 
WHY IS PEAK SOLEUS

peak

The 
maximal 
values 
of integrated

increased 
from 20.1

from 17.6 
mVs to 34.3 
mVs (95%) for the soleus 
and 
gastrocnemius 
muscles, 
respectively. 
The observation 
that 
peak 
soleus 
force 
remains 
nearly 
constant 
independent 
of speed 
of locomotion 
appears 
to be 
associated 
with an 
increase 
in activation 
of the 
soleus 
muscle 
and 
a 
change 
in contractile 
conditions 
that is not well suited 
to translate 
the 
increase 
in activity into large 
increases 
in force. 
The larger 
increase 
in 
gastrocnemius 
compared 
to soleus 
forces 
(for similar increases 
in IEMG activity) may be 
associated 
with the 
smaller 
rel:Qive velocity of contraction of the gastrocnemius fibers compared to the soleus fibers. 
THE EFFECT OF NEER CAPSULAR SHIFT ON THE PASSIVE GLENOHUMERAL

Passive

circumduction 
is a complex motion 
influenced 
by skeletal architecture and ligamentous 
restraints. 
In a previous 
study 
(Genoud

Hoffmeyer,

we quantified 
the movement 
of the 
proximal 
humerus against the glenoid in ten fresh frozen cadaveric specimens, 
using a magnetic tracking system (3SpaceTM 
Tracker System, Polhemus & Co). The rotator cuff muscles and the intact capsule were left in place for the 
measurements. 
Anterior and posterior passive 
circumductions were recorded. 
At the end of data acquisition, an inferior 
capsular 
shift procedure 
as described 
by Neer 
(1992) 
was 
performed 
for all shoulders 
and further data 
were

induce

diminished 
The

This implies that activities entailing not only elevation but also

must 
be 
carefully 
monitored 
in the 
pcst-cperative 
period.

STABILITY AS A CONSTRAINT ON PREFERRED FREQUENCY OF HUMAN 
WALKlNG:IMPLICATIONS FOR MOTOR CONTROL AND COORDINATION

An experiment was performed to determine the dynamic stability of the ankle, knee, and hip 
joints, and the head during adult walking. Eight subjects walked on a treadmill at a preferred rate, 
and at a rate predicted by the limbs modeled as a force-driven harmonic oscillator. Reflective 
markers were placed on anatomical landmarks of the head and joints. Sagittal plane data were 
digitized, filtered, and displacements were calculated using a motion analysis system. Stability 
was measured using the power spectra of the Fast Fourier Transformation of the time series, 
vertical displacement data for thirty continuous walking cycles. Linear regression analysis 
revealed a significant linear increase in spectral power (stability) in ascending the kinematic chain 
for both the preferred (R&975) 
and the predicted frequencies (R&961). 
From the results of the 
analysis of stability of the joints and head, it appears that any inconsistencies in the power- 
generating muscles (ankle plantar flexors) may be damped out in the kinematics in a hierarchical 
fashion. Joints closer to the head show greater stability than those closer to the interface with the 
ground. Thus, we may conceptualize the joint kinematics as being in service of the head in 
maintaining its stable trajectory. The need for both stability of certain systems and flexibility of 
others in a dynamical activity may be crucial for skilled performance.

SagittaI plane gait analysis was performed on fifteen young women (mean age 32&9yr) and 
sixteen 
elderly women (mean 
age 
71f6yr). 
The subjects 
walked barefoot at a self-selected 
pace, with 
retro-reflective markers 
attached 
over standard 
anatomical 
landmarks, 
while being video recorded 
by a 
100 Hz camera synchroniscd to a 200 Hz strobe light. Ranges 
of motion (ROM) were calculated 
from the video recordings, which were digitised at 50 Hz, corrected, and filtered at 6 Hz. The gait 
variables of velocity, cadence, stride length, swing time and stance time were calculated from 
instrumentation attached to the walkway. Elderly subjects walked at a slower velocity and step 
cadence, 
with a shorter stride length over a briefer swing time, and with a longer time spent 
in stance 
phase, 
and had less 
ROM during walking. Differences between 
groups for ROM during walking, and 
other kinematic gait variables were tested 
using two-way nested 
analysis 
of covariance. The greater 
ROM at the hip and knee joints of the younger subjects 
were fully explained by the greater stride 
length and velocity. It was not possible to further reduce the longer stride length of the younger 
subjects 
by the covariate 
of velocity. It was concluded 
that gait kinematics 
and 
joint ROM may not be 
fully inter-dependent 
factors during normal gait.

In this study the authors have used a palpation fixture in conjunction with an Isotrak sensor 
to study scapula 
movements 
during abduction. The spatial orientation of the scapula 
has been 
calculated: (a) in the scapular frame so 
that the initial position is defined as zero; (b) in the trunk frame and relative to its axes. In addition, the coordinates 
of the Root of the Scapula spine were measured 
relative to an origin at the sternum. 5 sequential measurements 
of 
scapular position were made 
by two independent 
observers

on normal 
subjects. Subsequently, 
8 patients 
with 
glenohumeral 
pathology 
were 
measured 
at 10 
deg. 
intervals 
of abduction. 
The reliability of the system was found to be good if rotations are defined in the scapular plane and referred 
to the initial position. However, when the starting position is taken into account, the angle of elevation is reduced 
in 
the patient group i.e. the shoulder 
is “dropped” 
so that the glenohumeral 
joint is slightly abducted 
in the resting 
position. Secondly, the horizontal coordinate of the root of the scapula spine is reduced suggesting 
some retraction 
of the scapula.

CONTACT AREAS IN THE WRIST JOINT

POBox 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands 
Contact areas in the wrist joint were calculated from computerized anatomical models. These 
models simulate the various discrete carpal bone positions that were documented during in vitro cadaver 
experiments using roentgenstereophotogrammetry. For every position the distances between relevant 
opposite surfaces were assessed. 
Based upon compressions of articular cartilage of 2.5 
- 40 % and an 
average cartilage thickness of 0.65 mm in the wrist joint, distances not exceeding -0.5 mm represent 
normal cartilage contact. The results show the distributions of the distances 
of a moving bone relative to 
a fixed bone. Contact areas of the lunate relative to the radius stay in position during deviation but 
become 
larger during ulnar deviation and somewhat 
smaller during radial deviation. There are no scapho- 
lunate contact areas and the distance between these bones become larger during ulnar deviation. It is an 
improvement to be able to calculate contact areas 
in the highly complex wrist joint without implementing 
experimental devices 
at the contact surfaces 
that disturb normal carpal kinematics. Also, the used 
method 
enables the study of small intercarpal contact areas besides 
the larger radiocarpal and midcapal areas.

CONTACT AREAS IN THE WRIST JOINT

Contact areas in the wrist joint were calculated from computerized anatomical models. These 
models simulate the various discrete carpal bone positions that were documented during in vitro cadaver 
experiments using roentgenstereophotogrammetry. For every position the distances between relevant 
opposite surfaces were assessed. 
Based upon compressions of articular cartilage of 2.5 
- 40 % and an 
average cartilage thickness of 0.65 mm in the wrist joint, distances not exceeding -0.5 mm represent 
normal cartilage contact. The results show the distributions of the distances 
of a moving bone relative to 
a fixed bone. Contact areas of the lunate relative to the radius stay in position during deviation but 
become 
larger during ulnar deviation and somewhat 
smaller during radial deviation. There are no scapho- 
lunate contact areas and the distance between these bones become larger during ulnar deviation. It is an 
improvement to be able to calculate contact areas 
in the highly complex wrist joint without implementing 
experimental devices 
at the contact surfaces 
that disturb normal carpal kinematics. Also, the used 
method 
enables the study of small intercarpal contact areas besides 
the larger radiocarpal and midcapal areas.

NON INVASIVE MEASUREMENT 
OF SCAPULA POSITION AND ITS USE TO !3TUDY THE =ING 
POSITION IN NORMAL AND PAINFUL SHOULDERS 
G R Johnson and P R Stuart, Centre for Rehabilitation and Engineering Studies, University of Newcastle upon 
Tyne, UK 
In this study the authors have used a palpation fixture in conjunction with an Isotrak sensor 
to study scapula 
movements 
during abduction. The spatial orientation of the scapula 
has been 
calculated: (a) in the scapular frame so 
that the initial position is defined as zero; (b) in the trunk frame and relative to its axes. In addition, the coordinates 
of the Root of the Scapula spine were measured 
relative to an origin at the sternum. 5 sequential measurements 
of 
scapular position were made 
by two independent 
observers 
15 
on normal 
subjects. Subsequently, 
8 patients 
with 
glenohumeral 
pathology 
were 
measured 
at 10 
deg. 
intervals 
of abduction. 
The reliability of the system was found to be good if rotations are defined in the scapular plane and referred 
to the initial position. However, when the starting position is taken into account, the angle of elevation is reduced 
in 
the patient group i.e. the shoulder 
is “dropped” 
so that the glenohumeral 
joint is slightly abducted 
in the resting 
position. Secondly, the horizontal coordinate of the root of the scapula spine is reduced suggesting 
some retraction 
of the scapula.

In general, 
the art. 
humeri 
is 
assumed to be a pure ball-socket 
joint 
(BSJ)with 
three 
degrees 
of freedom, 
around 
its 
center. 
However, 
whose humerus exclusively 
rotates 
in vivo 
measurements 
by X-ray 
series 
show that 
the momentary 
rotational 
center 
of the humerus 
is 
shifted 
towards 
the 
scapula 
in ab-adduction 
movements and in ex-internal 
rotations, 
respectively. 
These facts 
are morphologically 
based on the inconcruity 
of 
the curvatures 
of the opposed 
articular 
surfaces. 
The radii 
of the glenoid 
are a little 
bit 
greater 
than 
the humeral 
ones. 
Presented 
morphological 
measurements 
yield 
average 
differences 
R = 2,6mm (s = 1,7mm) and R = 2,8mm 
(s = 2,5mm) in the 
frontal 
and horizontal 
plane, 
resp.. 
The art. 
humeri 
can 
be modelled 
by an overlapping 
dimeric 
ball-socket-joint 
with 
five 
degrees 
of 
freedom. 
In functional 
movements the humerus rotates 
not only 
around 
its 
center 
but also 
simultaneously 
around 
the 
center 
of the 
glenoid 
in 
opposite 
direction. 
The ratio 
of the corresponding 
angular 
velocities 
determines 
the 
position 
ot the momentary 
rotational 
center.

theory

A study to quantify the flexion-extension 
and abduction-adduction moments at the knee during stair 
climbing was done using ten normal subjects. Data was collected using a four-camera optical system and a 
short flight of stairs incomorated 
onto two Kistlcr 
force plates. 
The imerse dynamics approach was 
implemented to calculate joint moments. 
Knee moments were normalized to subject weight and leg length 
and found to be similar for intrasubject and intersubject comparisons. Knee moment patterns and magnitudes 
were also very similar for the initiation and subsequent step during stair ascent and descent. Knee flexion- 
extension moments during stair descent were biphasic and of larger magnitude than the uniphasic flexion- 
extension moments during stair ascent. Knee abduction-adduction moments were biphasic during both stair 
ascent and descent. The peak abduction-adduction moments were slightly smaller than the flexion-extension 
moments during stair ascent and descent, but were of the same order of magnitude. In conclusion, this study 
indicates that the abduction-adduction 
moments at the knee, although not in the primary plane of motion, 
cannot be ignored when trying to understand the demands placed on the knee during stair climbing.

Direct Evidence of Acetabular Joint Preloading during Locomotion

Using pressure-instrumented 
femoral head prostheses 
in two subjects, we report here for the first time direct 
evidence 
of the timing and 
magnitudes 
of hip muscle co-contractionpreloading during gait, stair climbing, jumping, weight 
lifting, arising from a chair, and other locomotor ADL. Both subjects 
had pressure-instrumented 
prostheses 
containing FM 
radio transmitter8 inductively powered from an electromagnetic 
coil worn as a garter about the affected thigh. Full body 
bilateral kinematic and kinetic data 
were collected at the MGH Biomotion Laboratory using Selspot 
II and 
Kistler hardware, 
and analyzed with MIT’s TRACK and MGH’s post-TRACK processing software. These data were collected at 153 Hz 
during a subset 
of the longer hip sampling duration. Hip acetabular 
contact pressure increases 
always preceded 
ground 
contact, irrespective of the locomotor ADL examined. During gait, this hip preloading always occurred at least 100 msec 
prior to ground contact. During jumping onto the force plate8 
from a curb, even greater time-leads occurred, but during 
stair descent the temporal preloading was approximr+tely 
75 msec. The superior and.anterior femoral head experiences 
preloading pressures 
but the posterior femoral head experiences 
significant pressures 
only following opposite toe-off (1st 
peak of GRF) as the thigh rotates 
under the pelvis. Although the GRF clearly potentiates 
the acetabular 
contact pressures, 
both transducers’ peak pressures occur at times independent of the peak GRF. These data suggest that muscle CO- 
contraction prior to weight bearing is a consistent 
preloading acetabular 
stress. 
Despite the age, side, gender 
and 
body mass 
difference8 
between 
the two patients, the acetabular 
contact 
pressure 
data are remarkably consistent. 
Although it is possible 
that the phenomenon is vestibular-mediated, a more parsimonious explanation is that of habit, formed during life-long 
experience. These data also reveal that stress magnitudes increase 
with weight bearing, but not monotonically. Thus 
neither muscle co-contraction nor ground reaction forces are solely responsible 
for acetabular 
stresses.

A new approach is proposed to validate a musculo-skeletal human knee joint model by measuring directly 
the human quadriceps muscle forces during various tasks. Eight subjects (4 males and 4 females) with no history 
of knee injuries volunteered in this study. Each subject underwent a minor surgery under local anesthetic in order 
to implant a custom-made mercury strain gauge on the pate&r tendon. They performed eccentric and concentric 
contractions of the knee extensor and flexor muscle at various angular velocities on an &kinetic 
device. Also 
the subjects executed dynamic motions such as stand up, walking, running and jumping. During the testing 
session, the EMG signal of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, and semi-membranosus was 
collected at 1500 Hz while the torque, angular velocity and displacement were collected at 75 Hz using a custom- 
made data acquisition system. During the dynamic motions, the same muscles were recorded and synchronized 
with a video system and a force platform. The results from concentric and eccentric contractions showed that the 
tendon force followed similar torque pattern in eccentric and concentric phase of the contraction. It can be noticed 
that the EMG signal of the extensor muscles is very active like it should be while the flexor muscles are silent. 
From a broad jump, the EMG signals and tendon force were recorded. The tendon force pattern was similar as 
the vertical ground reaction force obtained from a force platform. Our preliminary data suggested that this new 
approach will make it possible to use the in vivo collected data to validate a musculo-skeletal knee joint model.

The reliability of a six degrees 
of freedom 
instrumented 
linkage - the Ankle Laxity Tester 
(ALT) in measuring 
the laxity characteristics 
of the Ankle Joint complex was evaluated 
in this study. The ALT measures 
these 
characteristics 
by recording 
both the motion produced 
at the ankle 
joint and 
the 
corresponding 
manually applied 
loads. The unique, non-serial structure of this linkage provides direct recording of the load-displacement 
properties 
in a simple, clinically relevant, anatomical 
coordinate 
system. The experiments 
were performed 
on 
eleven 
young healthy adults 
with no history of severe 
ankle ligament 
injuries. Five test-retest 
measurements 
of 
the load-displacement 
characteristics 
of both the left and 
right ankles 
were 
performed 
on each 
subject. Each 
test 
consisted 
of load-displacement 
measurements 
in dorsiflexion / plantarflexion; inversion/eversion 
and internal 
rotation/external 
rotation. The results of this study indicated that the ALT is highly reliable in measuring 
the 
load-displacement 
properties 
of the ankle ( coefficient of variation 5 6%). The results 
further indicated a high 
level of left-to-right symmetry in these 
characteristics 
in healthy adults. It was therefore concluded that the 
preliminary necessary, 
but not sufficient conditions, required for developing the ALT into a quantitative 
diagnostic 
tool for ankle 
ligament 
injuries were satisfied.

This study examined, 
in a sheep model, the effect of creating’s 
lesion in the outer, anterior 
annulus on the mechanics 
of the intervertebral 
joint complex and the disc. Forty one two year old 
Merino wethers were allocated randomly into a control group or an annular lesion group and 
additionally to non-survivors 
which were sacrificed immediately 
or survivors which were sacrificed six 
months later. The annular lesion group had incisions made in two non-adjacent 
intervertebral 
discs 
and a plate was secured across the vertebrae at one level. Mechanical tests were performed on 
isolated motion segments, first on the intact intervertebral 
joints and then after removal of the 
zygapophysial 
joints and the interspinous 
and supraspinous 
ligaments. 
In torsion, the creation of an 
annular lesion caused an immediate reduction in stiffness compared with controls. 
After six months 
the discs in the lesion groups approached the stiffness of the controls. 
The mechanics 
of the intact 
joints were not affected immediately 
by the lesion but after six months they were less stiff than the 
controls. 
There was clear evidence of a progressive degenerative 
response in the nucleus in all 
discs with a lesion. The addition of a plate to limit movement did not markedly affect this biological 
response to the injury but there was some evidence that after six months there were fewer 
degenerative 
changes to the zygapophysial 
joints in the plated specimens. 
Recovery of the 
mechanical 
integrity of the disc was more marked in the joints which were plated, supporting the 
concept that limiting motion of an injured intervertebral 
disc facilitates a healing response in the 
annulus.

it

The reliability of a six degrees 
of freedom 
instrumented 
linkage - the Ankle Laxity Tester 
(ALT) in measuring 
the laxity characteristics 
of the Ankle Joint complex was evaluated 
in this study. The ALT measures 
these 
characteristics 
by recording 
both the motion produced 
at the ankle 
joint and 
the 
corresponding 
manually applied 
loads. The unique, non-serial structure of this linkage provides direct recording of the load-displacement 
properties 
in a simple, clinically relevant, anatomical 
coordinate 
system. The experiments 
were performed 
on 
eleven 
young healthy adults 
with no history of severe 
ankle ligament 
injuries. Five test-retest 
measurements 
of 
the load-displacement 
characteristics 
of both the left and 
right ankles 
were 
performed 
on each 
subject. Each 
test 
consisted 
of load-displacement 
measurements 
in dorsiflexion / plantarflexion; inversion/eversion 
and internal 
rotation/external 
rotation. The results of this study indicated that the ALT is highly reliable in measuring 
the 
load-displacement 
properties 
of the ankle ( coefficient of variation 5 6%). The results 
further indicated a high 
level of left-to-right symmetry in these 
characteristics 
in healthy adults. It was therefore concluded that the 
preliminary necessary, 
but not sufficient conditions, required for developing the ALT into a quantitative 
diagnostic 
tool for ankle 
ligament 
injuries were satisfied.

This study examined, 
in a sheep model, the effect of creating’s 
lesion in the outer, anterior 
annulus on the mechanics 
of the intervertebral 
joint complex and the disc. Forty one two year old 
Merino wethers were allocated randomly into a control group or an annular lesion group and 
additionally to non-survivors 
which were sacrificed immediately 
or survivors which were sacrificed six 
months later. The annular lesion group had incisions made in two non-adjacent 
intervertebral 
discs 
and a plate was secured across the vertebrae at one level. Mechanical tests were performed on 
isolated motion segments, first on the intact intervertebral 
joints and then after removal of the 
zygapophysial 
joints and the interspinous 
and supraspinous 
ligaments. 
In torsion, the creation of an 
annular lesion caused an immediate reduction in stiffness compared with controls. 
After six months 
the discs in the lesion groups approached the stiffness of the controls. 
The mechanics 
of the intact 
joints were not affected immediately 
by the lesion but after six months they were less stiff than the 
controls. 
There was clear evidence of a progressive degenerative 
response in the nucleus in all 
discs with a lesion. The addition of a plate to limit movement did not markedly affect this biological 
response to the injury but there was some evidence that after six months there were fewer 
degenerative 
changes to the zygapophysial 
joints in the plated specimens. 
Recovery of the 
mechanical 
integrity of the disc was more marked in the joints which were plated, supporting the 
concept that limiting motion of an injured intervertebral 
disc facilitates a healing response in the 
annulus.

Calculations of forces acting on joints represent 
important goals of clinical and theoretical biomechanics. The 
method of graphical statics is a classical tool to estimate joint forces (PAUWELS 1935). Multibody analysis is 
becoming more and more important to analyze external joint forces dynamicly. The objective of this study is the 
development and testing of a 3D human dynamic multibody model which was generated

THE EFFECT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL HIP JOINT LOADING ON THE STRAIN

The tmnsverse 
acetabular 
ligament (TAL) has 
so far only been 
considered 
as 
an obstacle 
to the 
reduction 
of 
a congenitally dislocated 
hip, but nothing is yet known about 
its physiological function. We therefore 
investiga- 
ted 2 fresh and 4 fixed (3,7% formalin) hip joint specimens. 
Contact areas 
were determined 
using a polyether 
casting 
material. 
It was 
found that these 
are 
always 
located 
in the anterior 
and 
posterior 
horn of the lunate 
surface 
when a load of 350 N is applied to the 
joint. By means 
of an Omeaga 
strain gauge 
technique 
the strain of the 
TAL and 
the strain of the labrum close 
to the anterior 
and 
posterior 
horn was 
measured. 
Joint forces 
between 
10 
and 
2800 N (7 steps) 
were applied and the measurements 
were 
repeated 
with different degrees 
of rotation of the 
femoral head. 
The length of the TAL increases 
with the load applied to the hip joint by up to 4% (2800 N) 
whereas 
the labrum is only stretched 
by about 
0,5%. Changing 
the degree 
of rotation of the femoral head 
produ- 
ces 
slight differences, 
the strain being somewhat 
more pronounced 
in flexion. Calculating the strain of the liga- 
ment on the basis 
of the stance 
phases 
of the walking cycle finally shows that the TAL is cyclically stretched 
during walking. The position of the contact areas 
and the strain of ligament upon 
joint loading confirm the exi- 
stance 
of a physiological incongruity between 
the hip joint components. 
It is plausible that congruence 
is only 
gradually 
reached 
by widening of the acetabular 
notch 
as 
the 
joint force increases. 
It has 
been 
suggested 
that 
pri- 
mary incongruity is important for both, optimal stress 
distribution and better 
nourishment 
of the articular cartila- 
ge. 
It is conceivable 
that the TAL opposes 
the decrease 
of this functionally important incongruity. In conclusion 
it can 
be stated 
that the strain 
of the hgament 
is directly associated 
with static 
and 
dynamic loading of the 
hip.

The purpose 
of this study was to systematically 
study the effect of various sitting postures 
on lumbar, 
cervical and head 
posture. We also studied 
the relationship 
between 
lumbar posture 
(curve and 
inclination) and 
head, upper cervical, and lower cervical position. Measurements 
of spinal positions were obtained using a 
computerized, 
3-dimensionaJ 
digitizer that consisted 
of 6 angular displacement 
transducers 
arranged 
in series 
and 
attached 
to a hand-held 
touch probe. Anatomic landmarks 
were palpated 
and digitized with the probe and 
the 
following angles 
were 
assessed: 
head 
inclination, upper 
and 
lower cervical, cervical base 
inclination, lumbar 
inclination, lumbar curve and pelvic inclination. All analyses 
were confined to sagittal plane displacements. 
Healthy subjects (n=30) were seated on a stool without back support and measured 
in 4 different sitting 
postures assumed 
in random order. These were fully slumped, fully erect, “comfortable” and forward 
inclination (hip flexion with the lordosis maintained 
by use 
of a lumbar orthosis). Analysis of variance 
revealed 
significant 
differences 
in all spinal 
angles 
between 
different sitting positions 
except 
head 
inclination which was 
similar across 
all sitting postures. Moving from the slumped 
posture 
to the erect posture resulted in relative 
extension 
and anterior inclination of the lumbar spine, lower cervical flexion and upper cervical flexion. 
Regression 
analysis 
suggested 
only a weak relationship between 
lumbar position and cervical position and a 
stronger 
relationship between 
lumbar and pelvic position.

The tmnsverse 
acetabular 
ligament (TAL) has 
so far only been 
considered 
as 
an obstacle 
to the 
reduction 
of 
a congenitally dislocated 
hip, but nothing is yet known about 
its physiological function. We therefore 
investiga- 
ted 2 fresh and 4 fixed (3,7% formalin) hip joint specimens. 
Contact areas 
were determined 
using a polyether 
casting 
material. 
It was 
found that these 
are 
always 
located 
in the anterior 
and 
posterior 
horn of the lunate 
surface 
when a load of 350 N is applied to the 
joint. By means 
of an Omeaga 
strain gauge 
technique 
the strain of the 
TAL and 
the strain of the labrum close 
to the anterior 
and 
posterior 
horn was 
measured. 
Joint forces 
between 
10 
and 
2800 N (7 steps) 
were applied and the measurements 
were 
repeated 
with different degrees 
of rotation of the 
femoral head. 
The length of the TAL increases 
with the load applied to the hip joint by up to 4% (2800 N) 
whereas 
the labrum is only stretched 
by about 
0,5%. Changing 
the degree 
of rotation of the femoral head 
produ- 
ces 
slight differences, 
the strain being somewhat 
more pronounced 
in flexion. Calculating the strain of the liga- 
ment on the basis 
of the stance 
phases 
of the walking cycle finally shows that the TAL is cyclically stretched 
during walking. The position of the contact areas 
and the strain of ligament upon 
joint loading confirm the exi- 
stance 
of a physiological incongruity between 
the hip joint components. 
It is plausible that congruence 
is only 
gradually 
reached 
by widening of the acetabular 
notch 
as 
the 
joint force increases. 
It has 
been 
suggested 
that 
pri- 
mary incongruity is important for both, optimal stress 
distribution and better 
nourishment 
of the articular cartila- 
ge. 
It is conceivable 
that the TAL opposes 
the decrease 
of this functionally important incongruity. In conclusion 
it can 
be stated 
that the strain 
of the hgament 
is directly associated 
with static 
and 
dynamic loading of the 
hip.

The purpose 
of this study was to systematically 
study the effect of various sitting postures 
on lumbar, 
cervical and head 
posture. We also studied 
the relationship 
between 
lumbar posture 
(curve and 
inclination) and 
head, upper cervical, and lower cervical position. Measurements 
of spinal positions were obtained using a 
computerized, 
3-dimensionaJ 
digitizer that consisted 
of 6 angular displacement 
transducers 
arranged 
in series 
and 
attached 
to a hand-held 
touch probe. Anatomic landmarks 
were palpated 
and digitized with the probe and 
the 
following angles 
were 
assessed: 
head 
inclination, upper 
and 
lower cervical, cervical base 
inclination, lumbar 
inclination, lumbar curve and pelvic inclination. All analyses 
were confined to sagittal plane displacements. 
Healthy subjects (n=30) were seated on a stool without back support and measured 
in 4 different sitting 
postures assumed 
in random order. These were fully slumped, fully erect, “comfortable” and forward 
inclination (hip flexion with the lordosis maintained 
by use 
of a lumbar orthosis). Analysis of variance 
revealed 
significant 
differences 
in all spinal 
angles 
between 
different sitting positions 
except 
head 
inclination which was 
similar across 
all sitting postures. Moving from the slumped 
posture 
to the erect posture resulted in relative 
extension 
and anterior inclination of the lumbar spine, lower cervical flexion and upper cervical flexion. 
Regression 
analysis 
suggested 
only a weak relationship between 
lumbar position and cervical position and a 
stronger 
relationship between 
lumbar and pelvic position.

Calculations of forces acting on joints represent 
important goals of clinical and theoretical biomechanics. The 
method of graphical statics is a classical tool to estimate joint forces (PAUWELS 1935). Multibody analysis is 
becoming more and more important to analyze external joint forces dynamicly. The objective of this study is the 
development and testing of a 3D human dynamic multibody model which was generated 
with the ADAMS 
(Mechanical Dynamics. Inc., USA) &ware family. An analysis 
is run to simulate forces acting on the hip joint during 
seated 
cycling. 
The 
ADkMSIAndroid 
preprocessor 
was used 
to construct 
an accurate 
model of a male adult. The model 
was 
comprised 
of I5 segments, 
with a realistic location of joints. According to the 50 percentile 
rank, ADAMS/Android 
provided masses, 
centers 
of masses 
and moments of inertia of the burnan 
body and its limbs. As regards 
a preliminary 
work to test the applicability of the model, a man-bicycle-ion 
was run. The model was fixed at the saddle 
and 
the kinematic behaviour 
of the lower limbs was 
constrained 
by the geometry 
of the stationary 
bicycle. A complete set 
of 
muscles 
was not implemented, yet. Flexion and extension 
were established 
by forces 
acting 
on 
the 
hip. knee and ankle 
joint. Every degree of freedom was actuated by two driving elements (muscles). The components of the gluteus 
maximus muscle force during a 12 seconds 
cycling simuhNion 
are calculated.

The results

demonstrate

the capability of multibody analysis 
to evahmte 
non-linear equations of motion for large spatial mechanical systems and its applicability to consb-uct 
and analyze 
models of the human body. Our preliminary results are encouraging

The purpose of the present investigation was to measure the net passive elastic joint moment of the human 
knee joint over the full range of flexion-extension motion. The subject sample consisted of seventeen males 
between the ages of 22 and 31 years. Passive moments were measured using an instrumented apparatus based on 
the stiffness approach. The subjects’ leg was rotated (- 0.20 rad/s) through the full range of voluntary motion and 
beyond. To ensure the passive state, the surface EMG activity of the main flexors and extensors of the leg was 
recorded during the testing. The length of the biarticular muscles was held constant by setting the hip at 90° and 
the ankle at 0“ (neutral). The range of motion was separated into three phases (0 is the knee angle; O” is full 
extension): Extension (0 I%“): 
tlexion (8 295’) 
and midrange. (55’ < 0 < 95”). Exponential curve fitting was used 
to represent the extension ml 
tlexion phases while the midrange phase was represented by a linear regression line, 
The results indicate that potentially significant passive moments exist as the mechanical limits of the knee joint are 
sppmzzhed. At !%I1 
extension the mean moment measured was ahout I I N. m (range 6 N * 111 
to 22.5 N sm). At 
140” of flexion the mean moment was about 17.5 N am (range 5 N *m to 86 N em). The midrange phase was 
essentially a low stiftness, low moment region with values not exceeding 5 N em.

Fifteen elderly adults (8 men, 7 women, ji,, =71.3f3.5

a series 
of pre- and post- 
strength 
training assessments 
in order to: a) quantify the relationship 
between 
plantar flexor muscle 
strength, 
postural stability, and self-selected 
walking speeds, 
and b) determine 
the effect of a 16-week 
strength 
training program on postural stability and walking speed. Correlations between 
pre-training peak 
plantar flexor torque normalized to body mass 
(PFLEX) and pre-training descriptors 
of normal and fast 
walking speed 
and postural sway were low. PFLEX accounted for < 14% of the variation in postural 
sway and walking speed. Despite a 34% improvement 
in peak 
plantar flexor torque that resulted from 
strength 
training, normal and fast walking speeds 
and postural stability were not improved significantly. 
These 
results indicate that plantar flexor strength 
of these 
elderly subjects was not a limiting factor in the 
walking and postural stability tasks 
under investigation 
and that improvements 
in plantar flexor strength 
were not accompanied 
by improved performance 
in these 
functional tasks. This may be associated 
with a 
combination 
of the general well-being of the subjects 
under investigation and the level of the demands 
placed 
on the plantar flexors by these 
tasks.

The purpose of the present investigation was to measure the net passive elastic joint moment of the human 
knee joint over the full range of flexion-extension motion. The subject sample consisted of seventeen males 
between the ages of 22 and 31 years. Passive moments were measured using an instrumented apparatus based on 
the stiffness approach. The subjects’ leg was rotated (- 0.20 rad/s) through the full range of voluntary motion and 
beyond. To ensure the passive state, the surface EMG activity of the main flexors and extensors of the leg was 
recorded during the testing. The length of the biarticular muscles was held constant by setting the hip at 90° and 
the ankle at 0“ (neutral). The range of motion was separated into three phases (0 is the knee angle; O” is full 
extension): Extension (0 I%“): 
tlexion (8 295’) 
and midrange. (55’ < 0 < 95”). Exponential curve fitting was used 
to represent the extension ml 
tlexion phases while the midrange phase was represented by a linear regression line, 
The results indicate that potentially significant passive moments exist as the mechanical limits of the knee joint are 
sppmzzhed. At !%I1 
extension the mean moment measured was ahout I I N. m (range 6 N * 111 
to 22.5 N sm). At 
140” of flexion the mean moment was about 17.5 N am (range 5 N *m to 86 N em). The midrange phase was 
essentially a low stiftness, low moment region with values not exceeding 5 N em.

Fifteen elderly adults (8 men, 7 women, ji,, =71.3f3.5 
yrs) completed 
a series 
of pre- and post- 
strength 
training assessments 
in order to: a) quantify the relationship 
between 
plantar flexor muscle 
strength, 
postural stability, and self-selected 
walking speeds, 
and b) determine 
the effect of a 16-week 
strength 
training program on postural stability and walking speed. Correlations between 
pre-training peak 
plantar flexor torque normalized to body mass 
(PFLEX) and pre-training descriptors 
of normal and fast 
walking speed 
and postural sway were low. PFLEX accounted for < 14% of the variation in postural 
sway and walking speed. Despite a 34% improvement 
in peak 
plantar flexor torque that resulted from 
strength 
training, normal and fast walking speeds 
and postural stability were not improved significantly. 
These 
results indicate that plantar flexor strength 
of these 
elderly subjects was not a limiting factor in the 
walking and postural stability tasks 
under investigation 
and that improvements 
in plantar flexor strength 
were not accompanied 
by improved performance 
in these 
functional tasks. This may be associated 
with a 
combination 
of the general well-being of the subjects 
under investigation and the level of the demands 
placed 
on the plantar flexors by these 
tasks.

This study of 54 human ceMca1

was 
conducted to 
examine the biomechanical determinants of the centroid o 
P 
sagittal motion. The centroid position was 
defined in terms of the articular surfaces 
of the movin 
B 
vertebra, rather than in relation the to the 
subjacent 
vertebra. Lateral radiographs were taken o each specimen 
in the flexed and extended 
positions, then the coordinates of marker pins and points of each 
vertebral outline were digitized. The 
mean centroid position lay on the mid-perpendicular of the inferior articular facet (facet-point=OS). 
However the centroid lay sli 
vertebral body (disc-point= d 
htly behind the mid-perpendicular from the inferior surface of the moving 
.6). In agreement 
with previous studies, 
the distance of the centroid from the 
moving vertebral body decreased 
craniocaudally, 
while the height and angulation of the articular facets 
change 
in the reverse direction. Paired t-tests showed 
no segmental 
differences in facet-point or disc- 
point, so 
it is suggested 
that these are properties of the motion segment

Thirteen Pygmies (25 + 5 yrs, 1.53 + 0.04 m, 51.5 + 3.6 Kg) and 7 Caucasians (30 + 7 yrs, 
1.76 + 0.03 m, 70.6 + 3.6 Kg) were asked to walk, W, and run, R, on a treadmill from 4 to 12 Km/h. 
Simultaneous metabolic measurements and 3D motion analysis were performed. From these data 
energy expenditure and mechanical external and internal work, were calculated. 1) metabolic 
energy cost in Pygmies at all speeds 
was higher in W (p< 0.05) and lower in R (n.s.), 2) Pygmies’ 
stride frequency and internal mechanical work was higher at all speed 
of W and R (higher 
significance in W), 4) the external mechanical work was similar in both groups of subjects, 5) 
Pygmies’ total mechanical work is higher for W (p< 0.05) and showed no difference in R, 6) 
efficiency of locomotion is similar in all subjects and speeds. 
The higher cost of W in Pygmies is 
consistent with the allometric prediction for smaller subjects.The major de&minants 
of higher W 
cost is the difference in stride frequency (+9.45 f 0.44 % for Pygmies) which conversely affects the 
mechanical internal work. Hence total mechanical work is higher in walking Pygmies even with a 
non-significant difference in the external component. By having both higher mechanical work and 
higher metabolic cost of W, Pygmies’ efficiency of locomotion shows no difference with respect to 
Caucasians. Most of the differences between ethnic groups of the present work, when expressed 
as a diction 
of normalised speed (Froude and Strouhal numbers) tend to reduce.

At each

From

the

This

and 
a

Wext-

Differently 
from level

while 
the

for uphill walking. 
The

resulted 
to be.:

Thirteen Pygmies (25 + 5 yrs, 1.53 + 0.04 m, 51.5 + 3.6 Kg) and 7 Caucasians (30 + 7 yrs, 
1.76 + 0.03 m, 70.6 + 3.6 Kg) were asked to walk, W, and run, R, on a treadmill from 4 to 12 Km/h. 
Simultaneous metabolic measurements and 3D motion analysis were performed. From these data 
energy expenditure and mechanical external and internal work, were calculated. 1) metabolic 
energy cost in Pygmies at all speeds 
was higher in W (p< 0.05) and lower in R (n.s.), 2) Pygmies’ 
stride frequency and internal mechanical work was higher at all speed 
of W and R (higher 
significance in W), 4) the external mechanical work was similar in both groups of subjects, 5) 
Pygmies’ total mechanical work is higher for W (p< 0.05) and showed no difference in R, 6) 
efficiency of locomotion is similar in all subjects and speeds. 
The higher cost of W in Pygmies is 
consistent with the allometric prediction for smaller subjects.The major de&minants 
of higher W 
cost is the difference in stride frequency (+9.45 f 0.44 % for Pygmies) which conversely affects the 
mechanical internal work. Hence total mechanical work is higher in walking Pygmies even with a 
non-significant difference in the external component. By having both higher mechanical work and 
higher metabolic cost of W, Pygmies’ efficiency of locomotion shows no difference with respect to 
Caucasians. Most of the differences between ethnic groups of the present work, when expressed 
as a diction 
of normalised speed (Froude and Strouhal numbers) tend to reduce.

THREE DIMENSIONAL 
KINEMATICS 
OF THE REARFOOT DURING STANCE PHASE OF WALKING 
IN NORMAL YOUNG ADULT MALES.

Musculoskeletal disorders throughout the weightbearing system are often associated with abnormal foot motion . 
Most in-vivo studies have involved two dimensional analysis in the sag&al and coronal planes and suffer from 
errors due to out of plane movement. Previous attempts at three dimensional analysis (eg Kepple et al 1990) 
have been limited by poor calibration of embedded axes, small samples and lack of subject homogeneity. In the 
present study, using markers attached to the medial and posterior calcaneus and distal tibia, and a standard&d 
calibration procedure (Gant 1992), the neutral position of the foot and leg were defined. This was the zero 
position for the relative movements of plantar/dorsiflexion, in/eversion and ad/abduction. Subjects were filmed 
walking at their natural speed using four cameras, placed medial to the subject. Using a joint coordinate system 
and Euler angles, seqmental angular relationships were derived from marker positions. Data was time 
normal&d and ensemble averaged. The time histories of the related angles were similar to those reported by 
Kepple et al (1990). The mean coefficient of variation (Winter 1984) was 47.8% for plantar/dorsiflexion. 32.5% 
for in/eversion and 39.8% for ad/abduction. The current study showed later reversal of angles and less 
variability in the pattern and offset of the relative angles, than previous studies. A rigorous calibration procedure 
enabled standardisation of the neutral position of the foot and data obtained was not in agreement with previous 
assumptions regarding the large variability of rearfoot motion during stance between individuals.

In a prior study, we found that the action of the tibialis posterior was consistent within subjects, but there 
was less consistency between subjects. We therefore hypothesized that the traditional cause-effect relationship 
between muscle forces and resultant joint moments would be applicable at the ankle joint: there would be 
consistent inversion-eversion moments within subjects, but less consistency between subjects. We studied a 
group of 10 normal healthy adults (six men and four women) between the ages of 22 and 53. Each subject 
performed 4 trials at a freely-selected pace, walking barefoot on a level carpeted walkway. 
During each trial, 
the positions of the calf and foot in 3D space were captured using a video-based system and the ground 
reactions were captured with a six-component force plate. The inverse dynamics approach was used to calculate 
the resultant moment at the ankle, while the variance ratio (VR) statistic and factor analysis were used to 
analyze the data. 
We found that: (1) the plantarflexion-dorsiflexion 
moment, characterized by a small 
dorsiflexor moment at heel contact followed by a plantarflexor moment increasing from foot flat to a peak 
during push-off, was consistent both within individuals and also across the subject population; and (2) the 
inversion-eversion moment demonstrated low individual VRs, showing consistency within individuals, but across 
the population, it fell statistically into two categories which accounted for 100% of the variance: an inversion- 
eversion factor (62.3%) and a purely inverting factor (3 1.7%).

The effect of chiropractic manipulation on low back pain has been demonstrated in a number of studies 
using muscle strength, verbal reports, and psychophysical measures associated with the reduction of pain 
(Cassidy, 1982; Banks, 1983). However, very few studies have addressed this issue in terms of quantitative 
analyses of the improvements reported. The goal of this study was to measure and quantify the electromyographic 
response in the erector spinae muscles before and after a chiropratic treatment for low back pain. The task 
consisted of manipulating loads (20 and 100 N) over 180° of trunk rotation with and without a trunk flexion 
(30”). The speed of movement was keep constant (40 O/s 
f 5 Vs.) for all movements. The subject’s pelvis was 
fixed in order to avoid lower limb and hi movements. The maximum EMG values were recorded during maximal 
isometric trunk extensions. The EMG results are expressed in % IEMG. Seven subjetcs with chronic low back 
pain received 12 chiropratic treatments over a period of 4 weeks. All patients were tested before and after the 
treatment period. These results clearly showed a large reduction of %IEMG after treatment. The reduction was 
most pronouced when the rotation movement was combined with a flexion movement and also with an increase in 
load. Such a reduction was observed in five out of the seven subjects. The mean reduction for these fnre subjects 
was 12 %. These results extend the findings of the previous studies on the effects of spinal manipulation in the 
treatment of low back pain and interpreted as a reduction of comosnsatory muscular activity following spinal 
manipr.:,*ltion.

THE PREDICTION OF L5/Sl COMPRESSION FORCE DURING LIFl-ING 
Ogo S and Ishii K 
Nippon College of Physical Education, Tokyo, JAPAN 
The low-back, especially the lumbosacral disc (L5/Sl), is the hody part most highly stressed during 
lifting. The compression force acting on the L5/Sl disc has heen accepted at the primary measure of stress 
to the low-hack. The purpose of this study was to predict the compression force at L5/Sl disc in various 
lifting conditions. Seven male students were served as subjects in this study. All subjects lifted the load (14 
kg) from the floor to knuckle height with two symmetrical lifting techniques. One of two selected lifting 
techniques was leg-lift, that was squat with flexed knees and hip, and the trunk as erect as possible. The 
another was back-lift, that was stoop with extended knees and flexed hip. In each lifting technique, subjects 
performed lifting motion in three work duration (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 seconds) with given starting position (30 
cm) and three positions (distance from the load to toe. 15,30,45 cm) with given work duration (1.5 
seconds). There was no statistically significant difference between two lifting techniques in this study. The 
more the distance to load from body increase, the more the compression force acting on L51Sl disc 
increase. But there was no significant difference. This reason might he that on far position, subjects 
draw 
load near hody quickly. There was tendency that the more the work duration increase, the more L5/Sl 
compression force reduces. There was statistically significant difference between fast (1 
.O second) and 
slow (2.0 seconds) motion. Therefore, if the lifting is executed during extreme short duration, there is 
possibility that compression force at L5/S1 disc rapidly increases.

SPACEFLIGHT-INDUCED CHANGES IN POSTURE AND LOCOMOTION

Adaptive changes in central nervous system (CNS) processing of sensory inputs occur during 
spaceflight. Because these changes cause postfliiht instabilities in balance and locomotion, our 
laboratory has been studying posifliiht ataxia and the (@adaptive processes with the goal of designing 
effective countermeasures. This paper presents results from two of our ongoing studies. The first is 
examining the separate effects that inflight CNS adaptation has on the visual, vestibular, and ankle 
proprtoceptive sensory feedback systems. The second is quantifying postflight gait ataxia and, in 
particular, determining the extent to which head stability and eye-head coordination during locomotion 
are modified. Balance control and head stability during locomotion have been found to be seriously 
disrupted immediately following spaceflight. These disruptions are mediated by changes occurring in 
the vestibular feedback loop. It appears that postflight posture and locomotive strategies are designed to 
minimize head movements, presumably to offset the impacts of in-flight CNS reinterpretation of 
graviceptor inputs on visual stabilization and spatial orientation. Following spaceflight, a four to eight 
day readaptation period is required before posture and gait control return to preflight performance 
levels. During this period, the CNS must relearn how to optimally integrate information from the 
graviceptors into appropriate sensory-motor control schemes.

THE PREDICTION OF L5/Sl COMPRESSION FORCE DURING LIFl-ING 
Ogo S and Ishii K

The low-back, especially the lumbosacral disc (L5/Sl), is the hody part most highly stressed during 
lifting. The compression force acting on the L5/Sl disc has heen accepted at the primary measure of stress 
to the low-hack. The purpose of this study was to predict the compression force at L5/Sl disc in various 
lifting conditions. Seven male students were served as subjects in this study. All subjects lifted the load (14 
kg) from the floor to knuckle height with two symmetrical lifting techniques. One of two selected lifting 
techniques was leg-lift, that was squat with flexed knees and hip, and the trunk as erect as possible. The 
another was back-lift, that was stoop with extended knees and flexed hip. In each lifting technique, subjects 
performed lifting motion in three work duration (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 seconds) with given starting position (30 
cm) and three positions (distance from the load to toe. 15,30,45 cm) with given work duration (1.5 
seconds). There was no statistically significant difference between two lifting techniques in this study. The 
more the distance to load from body increase, the more the compression force acting on L51Sl disc 
increase. But there was no significant difference. This reason might he that on far position, subjects 
draw 
load near hody quickly. There was tendency that the more the work duration increase, the more L5/Sl 
compression force reduces. There was statistically significant difference between fast (1 
.O second) and 
slow (2.0 seconds) motion. Therefore, if the lifting is executed during extreme short duration, there is 
possibility that compression force at L5/S1 disc rapidly increases.

A 3-D-MODEL OF 
THE FOOT 
UTILISING A 3-COMPONENT FORCE 
DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM FOR INPUT

In this study 
a 3-dimensional, 
3-segmental, 
computer-aided 
model 
of the 
foot is developed 
for estimating 
internal 
stress 
factors 
which are 
essential 
for studying 
the load 
aspect 
of movement, 
shoes 
and 
ground. 
These 
factors 
are 
(1) bone-to-bone 
contact 
forces 
Fb, (2) shear 
forces 
Fs 
(which are 
usually 
not considered 
in the literature), 
and 
(3) 
joint moments 
Mj. The model 
consists 
of three 
joints which are 
(i) the 
metatarsophalangeal 
joint, (ii) the 
subtalar 
joint and 
(iii) the 
tibia-talar 
joint. As the 
distance 
between 
the 
external 
forces 
and 
the 
joints is an 
important 
factor for calculating 
moments, 
a 3-component 
force 
distribution 
platform is needed 
from which these 
distances 
are 
attained. 
To date, 
only l-component 
force 
distribution 
platforms 
are 
known, so 
a 3-component 
device 
has 
to be 
developed 
newly. 336 3-component 
low cost 
strain 
gage 
sensors 
were 
utilised, the 
sensitive 
area 
is sized 
200mm * 470mm. 
The 
following simulations 
are 
restricted 
to the 
static 
case 
and 
they 
are 
related 
to the 
subtalar 
joint. In all 
simulations 
the 
total vertical force 
Fz remains 
constant 
and 
both 
the 
longitudinal 
force 
Fy and 
the 
lateral 
force Fx 
are 
varied 
between 
0 and 
Fz. Among others 
the 
following results 
are 
gained. 
The shear 
force Fs increases 
with 
increasing 
Fx and 
Fs 
decreases 
with increasing 
Fy, both 
dependences 
are 
not linear. 
So 
the internal load of the 
ligamentous 
structures 
is increased 
with increasing 
Fx, whereas 
load 
is reduced 
with increasing 
Fy. The bone-to- 
bone 
contact 
force Fb is nearly 
independent 
from Fx. Furthermore, 
Fb increases 
linearely 
with increasing 
Fy 
which results 
in an 
increasing 
bone 
stress. 
The 
joint moment 
Mj of the 
subtalar 
joint decreases 
linearely with 
increasing 
Fx and 
with increasing 
Fy, which means 
that 
these 
external 
forces 
reduce 
muscle 
load. 
FLOATING SKELETON CONCEPT TO EXPLAIN CAUSES OF INJURIES IN SPINE AND SUC-

A fetus skeleton 
is “floating” 
entirely 
inside of the periosteum. 
We propose; 
that 
this remains 
true for mature 
sound human. 
Traditional 
anatomy 
however teaches about 
a number 
of separated 
joint 
capsules filled in with the synovial 
fluid. 
The aim of this work is not to prove experimentally 
a fluid connection 
between the capsules, but to show biomechanical 
advantages 
of such a situation. 
Separated joints approach 
leads to the Borelli-like 
models of muscle-skeleton 
system and spine . One 
can calculate 
tension in muscles, ligaments 
and bones under the condition, 
that constrains 
of a solid 
mechanics 
are applicable. 
The results of calculation 
of forces and torques in spine do not enable to 
consider a solid bodies model adequate to the reality, because of suspiciously 
high magnitude 
of these 
parameters, 
and mostly because there is no way to explain 
a cause of injury. 
The general hypothesis 
has been proposed 
that the joint 
capsules belong to the entire net of connected 
containers 
filled by 
the synovial fluid. 
The synovial 
fluid has equal pressure in each capsule. 
Connection 
of the capsules 
is provided 
by the fluid film between periosteum 
and bone surface. 
A METHOD FOR CONTINUALLY ESTIMATING INSTANTANEOUS BILATERAL ERECTOR SPINAE 
MUSCLE LOADS DURING PROLONGED, DYNAMIC LIFTING

This paper 
presents 
a method 
for estimating 
bilateral lumbar and thoracic erector spinae 
loads 
for a large 
number 
of sequential 
lifts to allow for the study of the effects of fatigue on lifting safety. The method 
required 
the continuous 
monitoring of spine 
posture 
and surface 
EMG from the spine 
extensors. 
The EMG was rectified, 
filtered and non-linearly normalized for a first approximation of muscle 
force and then spine 
posture data was 
used 
to estimate 
instantaneous 
muscle 
lengths 
and velocities and their subsequent 
force modulating 
effects. This 
procedure 
yielded a mechanically corrected 
EMG (EMG,J signal normalized 
to maximum. Eight male subjects 
were assessed 
as 
they performed repetitive, sagittal 
plane 
lifting during 20 minute 
and 
2 hour sessions. 
Isometric 
contractions 
were performed to establish 
the most 
appropriate 
low pass 
filter (mean 
= 2.7 Hz) and 
normalization 
(generally 
non-linear) 
parameters 
for matching 
externally measured 
extensor 
moments 
with surface 
EMG signals 
for each subject. The average 
RMS difference was 8.5% f2.456 for contractions with rapid force changes. 
Muscle force (BMG,) 
time-histories were estimated 
for over 6,300 dynamic lifts and compared 
to estimates 
derived with only BMG. Generally, the muscle loads were higher than EMG outputs (6-1296 of maximum) 
during the eccentric lowering phase 
and lower than EMG (17-34% of maximum) during the concentric lifting 
phase. 
These 
differences were assumed 
to represent 
“improvements” in muscle 
load estimate 
accuracy.

A 3-D-MODEL OF 
THE FOOT 
UTILISING A 3-COMPONENT FORCE 
DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM FOR INPUT

In this study 
a 3-dimensional, 
3-segmental, 
computer-aided 
model 
of the 
foot is developed 
for estimating 
internal 
stress 
factors 
which are 
essential 
for studying 
the load 
aspect 
of movement, 
shoes 
and 
ground. 
These 
factors 
are 
(1) bone-to-bone 
contact 
forces 
Fb, (2) shear 
forces 
Fs 
(which are 
usually 
not considered 
in the literature), 
and 
(3) 
joint moments 
Mj. The model 
consists 
of three 
joints which are 
(i) the 
metatarsophalangeal 
joint, (ii) the 
subtalar 
joint and 
(iii) the 
tibia-talar 
joint. As the 
distance 
between 
the 
external 
forces 
and 
the 
joints is an 
important 
factor for calculating 
moments, 
a 3-component 
force 
distribution 
platform is needed 
from which these 
distances 
are 
attained. 
To date, 
only l-component 
force 
distribution 
platforms 
are 
known, so 
a 3-component 
device 
has 
to be 
developed 
newly. 336 3-component 
low cost 
strain

sensors 
were 
utilised, the

area 
is sized 
200mm * 470mm. 
The 
following simulations 
are 
restricted 
to the 
static 
case 
and 
they 
are 
related 
to the 
subtalar 
joint. In all 
simulations 
the 
total vertical force 
Fz remains 
constant 
and 
both 
the 
longitudinal 
force 
Fy and 
the 
lateral 
force Fx 
are 
varied 
between 
0 and 
Fz. Among others 
the 
following results 
are 
gained. 
The shear 
force Fs increases 
with 
increasing 
Fx and 
Fs 
decreases 
with increasing 
Fy, both 
dependences 
are 
not linear. 
So 
the internal load of the 
ligamentous 
structures

A fetus skeleton 
is “floating” 
entirely 
inside of the periosteum. 
We propose; 
that 
this remains 
true for mature 
sound human. 
Traditional 
anatomy 
however teaches about 
a number 
of separated 
joint 
capsules filled in with the synovial 
fluid. 
The aim of this work is not to prove experimentally 
a fluid connection 
between the capsules, but to show biomechanical 
advantages 
of such a situation. 
Separated joints approach 
leads to the Borelli-like 
models of muscle-skeleton 
system and spine . One 
can calculate 
tension in muscles, ligaments 
and bones under the condition, 
that constrains 
of a solid 
mechanics 
are applicable. 
The results of calculation 
of forces and torques in spine do not enable to 
consider a solid bodies model adequate to the reality, because of suspiciously 
high magnitude 
of these 
parameters, 
and mostly because there is no way to explain 
a cause of injury. 
The general hypothesis 
has been proposed 
that the joint 
capsules belong to the entire net of connected 
containers 
filled by 
the synovial fluid. 
The synovial 
fluid has equal pressure in each capsule. 
Connection 
of the capsules 
is provided

A METHOD FOR CONTINUALLY ESTIMATING INSTANTANEOUS BILATERAL ERECTOR SPINAE 
MUSCLE LOADS DURING PROLONGED, DYNAMIC LIFTING

This paper 
presents 
a method 
for estimating 
bilateral lumbar and thoracic erector spinae 
loads 
for a large 
number 
of sequential 
lifts to allow for the study of the effects of fatigue on lifting safety. The method 
required 
the continuous 
monitoring of spine 
posture 
and surface 
EMG from the spine 
extensors. 
The EMG was rectified, 
filtered and non-linearly normalized for a first approximation of muscle 
force and then spine 
posture data was 
used 
to estimate 
instantaneous 
muscle 
lengths 
and velocities and their subsequent 
force modulating 
effects. This 
procedure 
yielded a mechanically corrected 
EMG (EMG,J signal normalized 
to maximum. Eight male subjects 
were assessed 
as 
they performed repetitive, sagittal 
plane 
lifting during 20 minute 
and 
2 hour sessions. 
Isometric 
contractions 
were performed to establish 
the most 
appropriate 
low pass 
filter (mean 
= 2.7 Hz) and 
normalization 
(generally 
non-linear) 
parameters 
for matching 
externally measured 
extensor 
moments 
with surface 
EMG signals 
for each subject. The average 
RMS difference was 8.5% f2.456 for contractions with rapid force changes. 
Muscle force (BMG,) 
time-histories were estimated 
for over 6,300 dynamic lifts and compared 
to estimates 
derived with only BMG. Generally, the muscle loads were higher than EMG outputs (6-1296 of maximum) 
during the eccentric lowering phase 
and lower than EMG (17-34% of maximum) during the concentric lifting 
phase. 
These 
differences were assumed 
to represent 
“improvements” in muscle 
load estimate 
accuracy.

A 3-D-MODEL OF 
THE FOOT 
UTILISING A 3-COMPONENT FORCE 
DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM FOR INPUT 
Klaus Peikenkamp, 
Jorg Natrup and 
Klaus Nicol 
Institut fttr Bewegungswissenschaften, 
Universimt 
Mtinster, 
Germany 
In this study 
a 3-dimensional, 
3-segmental, 
computer-aided 
model 
of the 
foot is developed 
for estimating 
internal 
stress 
factors 
which are 
essential 
for studying 
the load 
aspect 
of movement, 
shoes 
and 
ground. 
These 
factors 
are 
(1) bone-to-bone 
contact 
forces 
Fb, (2) shear 
forces 
Fs 
(which are 
usually 
not considered 
in the literature), 
and 
(3) 
joint moments 
Mj. The model 
consists 
of three 
joints which are 
(i) the 
metatarsophalangeal 
joint, (ii) the 
subtalar 
joint and 
(iii) the 
tibia-talar 
joint. As the 
distance 
between 
the 
external 
forces 
and 
the 
joints is an 
important 
factor for calculating 
moments, 
a 3-component 
force 
distribution 
platform is needed 
from which these 
distances 
are 
attained. 
To date, 
only l-component 
force 
distribution 
platforms 
are 
known, so 
a 3-component 
device 
has 
to be 
developed 
newly. 336 3-component 
low cost 
strain 
gage 
sensors 
were 
utilised, the 
sensitive 
area 
is sized 
200mm * 470mm. 
The 
following simulations 
are 
restricted 
to the 
static 
case 
and 
they 
are 
related 
to the 
subtalar 
joint. In all 
simulations 
the 
total vertical force 
Fz remains 
constant 
and 
both 
the 
longitudinal 
force 
Fy and 
the 
lateral 
force Fx 
are 
varied 
between 
0 and 
Fz. Among others 
the 
following results 
are 
gained. 
The shear 
force Fs increases 
with 
increasing 
Fx and 
Fs 
decreases 
with increasing 
Fy, both 
dependences 
are 
not linear. 
So 
the internal load of the 
ligamentous 
structures 
is increased 
with increasing 
Fx, whereas 
load 
is reduced 
with increasing 
Fy. The bone-to- 
bone 
contact 
force Fb is nearly 
independent 
from Fx. Furthermore, 
Fb increases 
linearely 
with increasing 
Fy 
which results 
in an 
increasing 
bone 
stress. 
The 
joint moment 
Mj of the 
subtalar 
joint decreases 
linearely with 
increasing 
Fx and 
with increasing 
Fy, which means 
that 
these 
external 
forces 
reduce 
muscle 
load.

This study focused 
on a biomechanical 
assessment 
of function impairments 
in a clinical context. 
A Computer Assisted 
HaNd-held DYnamometer 
(CAHN-DY) was used 
to perform dynamic function 
tests, such 
as strength 
tests, under standardized 
conditions. Different from isokinetics, test conditions 
were derived from biomechanical 
analyses 
of functional abilities, such 
as rising from a chair. In 
addition, these 
analyses 
provided a framework for the interpretation 
of test results. 
The above 
approach 
was illustrated by presenting 
a test for knee 
extension 
strength 
related to 
the ability “rising from a chair”. The practicability of this dynamic function test was evaluated 
on 
patients 
in clinical settings 
of physical therapy. The results imply that therapists 
are able to perform this 
rather complex dynamic function test according 
to the standard, 
using signal checks 
and feedback 
of 
the CAHN-DY. For better achieving maximal test results (ie. muscle 
strength) 
some 
changes 
in the test 
protocol are suggested 
to simplify the dynamic conditions of the function test.

The 
performance 
of 
a 
mechanical 
system 
is 
conditioned 
by 
its 
geometrical 
configuration 
and by the 
elastic 
properties 
of 
the 
materials 
it 
is made of as much as 
by the 
mechanical 
loads 
which 
are applied 
to it. 
In conformity 
we developed 
a numerical 
"automaton" 
controlled 
interactively 
by the 
user 
through 
pull-down 
menus and which 
is 
capable 
of 
generating 
a succession 
of 
complete 
configurations 
assumed by the 
vertebral 
column 
in 
the 
course 
of 
any movement 
it 
performs. 
These 
configurations 
represent 
with 
realism 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
column 
at 
the 
corresponding 
instants 
in 
the 
movement 
and 
satisfy 
entirely 
the 
structural, 
kinematical 
and dynamical 
constraints 
involved 
in 
the 
natural 
movements 
of 
the 
vertebral 
column. 
Once the 
loading 
system 
is 
entered 
by the 
user, 
the 
automaton 
responds 
to 
it 
as a multi-segmented 
beam shaped 
according 
to 
the 
curvatures 
the 
user 
chose 
to 
give 
it. 
The forces 
applied 
to 
the 
head, 
chest 
and upper 
limbs 
are 
simply 
transferred 
to 
the 
corresponding 
regions 
of the 
column 
by means of the 
technique 
of 
adding 
a torque 
equal 
to 
that 
it 
would 
exert 
at 
the 
original 
point 
of 
application. 
The mechanical 
response 
of 
the 
automaton 
is 
calculated 
by 
finite 
element 
methods 
and 
the 
whole 
package 
is perfectly 
portable.

The motion 
of 
a body 
segment 
is 
often 
considered 
as that 
of a rigid 
body. 
Over the past 
few years 
several 
methods 
were proposed 
to characterize 
this 
motion 
in 3D from the measurement 
of the 
trajectory 
of at least 
3 non 
colinear 
surface 
markers 
attached 
to 
the 
skin. 
In the 
present 
work, 
a new 
method, 
based 
on the 
decomposition 
theorem, 
has been used to 
separate 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
solid 
(rotation 
matrix 
R) 
from 
its 
apparent 
deformation 
(tensor 
of 
deformation 
U) due to 
skin 
marker 
movements 
and measurement 
errors 
of the 
3D trajectography 
system. 
Several 
estimates 
of the 
centre 
of 
rotation 
(CR) were made from the determination 
of the 
instantaneous 
helical 
axis 
of 
motion 
(IHA): 
instantaneous 
centre 
of 
rotation 
(ICR), 
averaged 
centre 
of 
rotation 
(ACR) and interval 
averaged 
centre 
of 
rotation 
(IACR). 
Calculations 
were 
performed 
with 
theoretic 
pendulum 
data 
and 
real 
arm 
movement 
test 
data 
on five 
subjects. 
Results 
show that 
ICRs are 
located 
inside 
a 33 mm sphere 
centered 
on the 
ACR and that 
ACR location 
is 
in 
agreement 
with 
the CR position 
given 
by anatomists.

This study focused 
on a biomechanical 
assessment 
of function impairments 
in a clinical context. 
A Computer Assisted 
HaNd-held DYnamometer 
(CAHN-DY) was used 
to perform dynamic function 
tests, such 
as strength 
tests, under standardized 
conditions. Different from isokinetics, test conditions 
were derived from biomechanical 
analyses 
of functional abilities, such 
as rising from a chair. In 
addition, these 
analyses 
provided a framework for the interpretation 
of test results. 
The above 
approach 
was illustrated by presenting 
a test for knee 
extension 
strength 
related to 
the ability “rising from a chair”. The practicability of this dynamic function test was evaluated 
on 
patients 
in clinical settings 
of physical therapy. The results imply that therapists 
are able to perform this 
rather complex dynamic function test according

some

in the test 
protocol are suggested 
to simplify the dynamic conditions of the function test.

The goal of this paper is to show the hetemgeneity 
in the motion behsviour 
of scoliotic spines. 
Clinical testings 
illustrate the 
phenomenon. 
Three dimensional 
analyses 
of the scoliotic spine 
of patients 
in stsnding

A new 
testing 
of the moving scoliotic patient is presented. 
The markers 
trajectories 
in the laboratory 
freme 
are 
obtained 
from 5 csmeres 
(Frequency 
60 Hz) in flexion extension 
movement. 
The 
petient 
is asked 
to move

the patient

is studied. 
Several 
treatments 
ere applied 
to the rough 
markers 
trajectories. 
Two 
kinds 
of pertubing 
noises 
are 
successively 
identified: 
the 
slipping 
effect of marker and 
skin versus 
the underlying 
soft tissues 
and 
the interference 
of relative 
muscular 
displacements 
versus 
the spine. 
The main 
goal of this treatment 
is to represent 
the moving 
scoliotic 
spine 
as 
s set 
of rigid links joined together 
and to correlate 
the location 
of joints along the spine with that of the discontinuous 
zones. 
Two kinds of approach 
ere tested. 
The fust one consists 
in modelling 
the 
geometrical 
shape 
of the internal spine 
from the instant 
location 
of external 
spinous 
process 
markers. 
The second 
one essumes 
that the beck 
motion may be modelled es mechanical 
chain with rigid links joined together. 
The kinematical 
study locates 
the joints end verify the 
essumption 
of the rigidity of the bock 
segments. 
50 scoliotic patients 
has 
been 
tested 
by physiotherapists. 
The flexion extension 
mobility in motion has 
been 
evslueted 
through 
the 
measurement 
of the distances 
between 
adjacent 
spinous 
processes 
from L5 to Tl. A table is presented 
showing the heterogeneity 
in the 
distribution of mobility along the spine. 
This 
heterogeneity 
is shown 
through 
the computixed 
analysis 
by mean 
of regional planes

the scoliotic 
spine 
in s patient Xrayed 
in static 
position. 
A new experiment 
in moving 
scoliotic 
patients

The flexion 
extension 
motion of the patieni is studied from external markers 
in the goal of refbtding the heterogeneous 
behaviout of the moving 
scoliotic spine. 
A specific software has been developed

orthopsedic 
treatments

Temporal as well as spatial parameters characterizing 
the movement 
patterns of ten Dutch 
warmblood 
horses were determined 
during overground (both asphalt and rubber) and treadmill 
locomotion. 
Initially the horses were led at their preferred velocities in walk and in trot. 
Subsequently, 
after a one-week training program data for the treadmill condition were obtained at 
corresponding 
speeds. 
Comparing treadmill and rubber ground locomotion 
at trot it was found that on the treadmill 
the relative stance duration was longer, the hoof heights of both fore and hind limbs were lower, 
the amplitude of the retraction 
angles of the fore and hind limbs were larger, and the vertical 
movement of the trunk was reduced. The stride duration did not appear to be different. 
For 
locomotion 
on asphalt it was found that the stance duration was shorter than on the treadmill, 
but 
longer than on rubber ground. Pro- and retraction angles were on asphalt smaller, while the stride 
duration was shorter than under both other conditions. 
The constancy 
of stride on the treadmill 
turned out to be twice as high as under both overground conditions. 
It was concluded that, even 
when similar surfaces and satisfactorily 
long training periods are considered, differences 
relative to 
overground locomotion 
should be reckoned with when gait patterns on a treadmill are analysed. 
However, the great constancy 
on the treadmill remains all advantage of this device.

It was concluded that, even 
when similar surfaces and satisfactorily 
long training periods are considered, differences 
relative to 
overground locomotion 
should be reckoned with when gait patterns on a treadmill are analysed. 
However, the great constancy 
on the treadmill remains all advantage of this device.

The goal of this paper is to show the hetemgeneity 
in the motion behsviour 
of scoliotic spines. 
Clinical testings 
illustrate the 
phenomenon. 
Three dimensional 
analyses 
of the scoliotic spine 
of patients 
in stsnding 
position confm the clinical observetions. 
A new 
testing 
of the moving scoliotic patient is presented. 
The markers 
trajectories 
in the laboratory 
freme 
are 
obtained 
from 5 csmeres 
(Frequency 
60 Hz) in flexion extension 
movement. 
The 
petient 
is asked 
to move 
his back. 
Pelvis 
is kept ss motionless 
ss 
possible. 
Then 
the patient 
w&s along 
e straight 
tmil end his beck 
motion 
is studied. 
Several 
treatments 
ere applied 
to the rough 
markers 
trajectories. 
Two 
kinds 
of pertubing 
noises 
are 
successively 
identified: 
the 
slipping 
effect of marker and 
skin versus 
the underlying 
soft tissues 
and 
the interference 
of relative 
muscular 
displacements 
versus 
the spine. 
The main 
goal of this treatment 
is to represent 
the moving 
scoliotic 
spine 
as 
s set 
of rigid links joined together 
and to correlate 
the location 
of joints along the spine with that of the discontinuous 
zones. 
Two kinds of approach 
ere tested. 
The fust one consists 
in modelling 
the 
geometrical 
shape 
of the internal spine 
from the instant 
location 
of external 
spinous 
process 
markers. 
The second 
one essumes 
that the beck 
motion may be modelled es mechanical 
chain with rigid links joined together. 
The kinematical 
study locates 
the joints end verify the 
essumption 
of the rigidity of the bock 
segments. 
50 scoliotic patients 
has 
been 
tested 
by physiotherapists. 
The flexion extension 
mobility in motion has 
been 
evslueted 
through 
the 
measurement 
of the distances 
between 
adjacent 
spinous 
processes 
from L5 to Tl. A table is presented 
showing the heterogeneity 
in the 
distribution of mobility along the spine. 
This 
heterogeneity 
is shown 
through 
the computixed 
analysis 
by mean 
of regional planes 
fitting 
the scoliotic 
spine 
in s patient Xrayed 
in static 
position. 
A new experiment 
in moving 
scoliotic 
patients 
is presently 
beginning. 
The flexion 
extension 
motion of the patieni is studied from external markers 
in the goal of refbtding the heterogeneous 
behaviout of the moving 
scoliotic spine. 
A specific software has been developed 
for clinical applications. 
It is presently 
used 
to quantify the correcting effects of both 
orthopsedic 
treatments 
and surgical 
operations. 
The results 
are 
discussed. 
The results 
of the kinematic 
analysis 
describing 
the motion 
of the 
beck through the treatment 
of externsl signals 
sre compared 
to that of the X-ray study. 
If obvious 
correlations 
would be demonstrated 
s 
fee&e testing 
protocol will be defined 
and 
the motion 
non invasive 
test 
will be substituted 
to the 
present 
X-rays examination.

Temporal as well as spatial parameters characterizing 
the movement 
patterns of ten Dutch 
warmblood 
horses were determined 
during overground (both asphalt and rubber) and treadmill 
locomotion. 
Initially the horses were led at their preferred velocities in walk and in trot. 
Subsequently, 
after a one-week training program data for the treadmill condition were obtained at 
corresponding 
speeds. 
Comparing treadmill and rubber ground locomotion 
at trot it was found that on the treadmill 
the relative stance duration was longer, the hoof heights of both fore and hind limbs were lower, 
the amplitude of the retraction 
angles of the fore and hind limbs were larger, and the vertical 
movement of the trunk was reduced. The stride duration did not appear to be different. 
For 
locomotion 
on asphalt it was found that the stance duration was shorter than on the treadmill, 
but 
longer than on rubber ground. Pro- and retraction angles were on asphalt smaller, while the stride 
duration was shorter than under both other conditions. 
The constancy 
of stride on the treadmill 
turned out to be twice as high as under both overground conditions. 
It was concluded that, even 
when similar surfaces and satisfactorily 
long training periods are considered, differences 
relative to 
overground locomotion 
should be reckoned with when gait patterns on a treadmill are analysed. 
However, the great constancy 
on the treadmill remains all advantage of this device.

DEVELOPING A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE HUMAN LARYNX: TESTING TWO 
PROPOSED

To interpret 
the underlying 
pathology 
of abnormal 
vocal fold movement 
patterns, 
we are 
studying 
the 
mechanisms 
underlying vocal fold abduction 
and 
adduction. In the 
present 
study 
we have 
focused 
on the 
movement 
at the 
cricoarytenoid 
joint. We hypothesized 
that the three 
dimensional 
movement 
of 
the 
arytenoid 
cartilage 
relative to the 
cricoid cartilage 
can 
be 
estimated 
by comparing 
the 
movement 
of a 
model 
of the 
joint to the movement 
of the larynx recorded 
on high speed 
video data 
through 
a straight 
rod laryngoscope. 
30 seconds 
of various 
movements 
during respiration 
and 
speech 
requiring vocal fold 
adduction 
and 
abduction 
were 
recorded. We are 
presenting 
the 
preliminary results 
of testing 
two 
models 
of the 
cricoarytenoid 
joint, each 
of which has 
been 
proposed 
in the literature: 1. 
that the 
arytenoid 
rotates 
around 
a vertical axis or 2. that the arytenoid 
rotates 
around 
the long axis of the 
cricoid articular facet. The test 
was 
how well predictions 
based 
on each 
of the 
models 
agreed 
with the 
digitized video 
recordings. 
There 
are 
no distinct landmarks 
on the video image 
because 
of the structure 
of the larynx. We 
estimated 
the location of two sites 
in the 
field of view: the vocal 
process 
and 
the 
bulge 
created 
by the 
superior 
tip of the arytenoid 
underneath 
tissue. Further 
work is required 
to quantify the 
errors 
in this 
approach. 
We feel that the locations 
we have 
chosen, 
while not perfect, 
are 
adequate 
for the 
purposes 
of 
rejecting Model 1 
and 
accepting 
Model 2 as 
a first approximation.

The point at which rehabilitation of the ankle 
joint complex after injury can be considered 
complete and 
terminated 
is not clear. It is assumed 
that normal function is restored 
when the injured ankle has 
the same 
strength 
and 
range 
of motion as 
the contralateral 
limb although 
this has 
never 
been 
quantified. The purpose 
of this investigation 
was 
to determine 
if differences 
in the 
ankle 
joint complex 
range 
of motion occur 
between 
right and 
left legs. A six de.ee of freedom 
fixture was 
impleluentzti to ev;llll.hte 
the 
r.lll~r I 
,f lllrllion of 111~ 
foot relative 
to the 
leg for 18 
subjects. 
The fixture accommodated 
three rotation:11 
degrech 
of freedom 
\&I~+ 
were based 
on an Euler angle measurement 
system: 
dorsiflexion-plantarflexion, eversion-inversion, 
and 
abduction-adduction. 
A four camera 
video system 
was 
used 
to record 
all range 
of motion movements. The 
results 
indicated 
that total doriflexion-plantarfexion, eversion-inversion, 
and 
abduction-adduction 
ranges 
of 
motion were not significantly different between 
right and left legs. However, separate 
abduction and 
adduction 
differences 
did occur with the right foot tending to abduct 
more than the left, while the left foot 
tended 
to adduct 
more 
than 
the 
right. These 
differences 
in the abduction 
and 
adduction 
range 
of motion may 
be inherent 
in the measuring 
device. It appears 
that the contralateral 
ankle 
joint complex can be used 
as 
a 
measure 
for establishing 
restoration 
of total motion 
of the 
ankle 
joint complex 
following injury. 
ENHANCED SPINAL FIXATION TO THE PELVIS USING SEGMENTAL INSTRUMENTATION AND A 
NEW SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

A new method for spino-pelvic fixation for segmental 
instrumentation 
was evaluated 
by biomechanical 
testing. The new technique 
uses 
rods with threaded 
L-shaped 
ends, passed 
through the ilium perpendicular 
to 
the axis of the spine at the level of Sl, anterior to the posterior superior iliac spine. The rods were fixed at all 
levels (T8 to L5) using sublaminar 
wires, and the distal threaded 
ends 
were fixed by washers 
and spherical 
nuts 
which allowed the washers 
to seat 
flat against 
the iliac surface. Nine cadaveric 
specimens, 
( T6 to the sacrum 
with intact pelvis) were tested 
on an MTS 858 mechanical 
testing machine; uniaxial compression 
was applied 
in bilateral and unilatera1 
ischial weight-bearing. Specimens 
were tested 
intact, after instrumentation 
with the 
new technique, and after instrumentation 
with the Galveston 
technique. The new technique 
provided greater 
stability than the Galveston 
technique in each loading mode, exhibiting decreased 
overall displacements, 
and 
increased 
axial stiffness. Overall as compared 
directly to the Galveston 
technique, the new method exhibited 
average 
increased 
stiffness 
of 31% for bilateral loading to 222 N, 14% for bilateral loading to 445 N, and 20% 
for unilateral loading to 222 N. 
The new technique 
therefore is biomechanically superior to the Galveston 
technique, 
and eliminates 
the need 
for complex 
three-dimensional 
rod bending 
to conform to the contours 
of the 
iliac wings. The greater stability achieved 
with the technique 
may help to prevent loss of correction of pelvic 
obliquity and rod failure that have 
been 
reported with SSI to the pelvis using the Galveston 
fixation.

underlying vocal fold abduction 
and 
adduction. In the 
present 
study 
we have 
focused 
on the 
movement 
at the 
cricoarytenoid 
joint. We hypothesized 
that the three 
dimensional 
movement 
of 
the 
arytenoid 
cartilage 
relative to the 
cricoid cartilage 
can 
be 
estimated 
by comparing 
the 
movement 
of a 
model 
of the 
joint to the movement 
of the larynx recorded 
on high speed 
video data 
through 
a straight 
rod laryngoscope. 
30 seconds 
of various 
movements 
during respiration 
and 
speech 
requiring vocal fold 
adduction 
and 
abduction 
were 
recorded. We are 
presenting 
the 
preliminary results 
of testing 
two 
models 
of the 
cricoarytenoid 
joint, each 
of which has 
been 
proposed 
in the literature: 1. 
that the 
arytenoid 
rotates 
around 
a vertical axis or 2. that the arytenoid 
rotates 
around 
the long axis of the 
cricoid articular facet. The test 
was 
how well predictions 
based 
on each 
of the 
models 
agreed 
with the 
digitized video 
recordings. 
There 
are 
no distinct landmarks 
on the video image 
because 
of the structure 
of the larynx. We 
estimated 
the location of two sites 
in the 
field of view: the vocal 
process 
and 
the 
bulge 
created 
by the 
superior 
tip of the arytenoid 
underneath 
tissue. Further 
work is required 
to quantify the 
errors 
in this 
approach. 
We feel that the locations 
we have 
chosen, 
while not perfect, 
are 
adequate 
for the 
purposes 
of 
rejecting Model 1 
and 
accepting 
Model 2 as 
a first approximation. 
RIGHT TO LEFT DIFFERENCES OF ANKLE JOINT COMPLEX RANGE OF MOTION

The point at which rehabilitation of the ankle 
joint complex after injury can be considered 
complete and 
terminated 
is not clear. It is assumed 
that normal function is restored 
when the injured ankle has 
the same 
strength 
and 
range 
of motion as 
the contralateral 
limb although 
this has 
never 
been 
quantified. The purpose 
of this investigation 
was 
to determine 
if differences 
in the 
ankle 
joint complex 
range 
of motion occur 
between 
right and 
left legs. A six de.ee of freedom 
fixture was 
impleluentzti to ev;llll.hte 
the 
r.lll~r I 
,f lllrllion of 111~ 
foot relative 
to the 
leg for 18 
subjects. 
The fixture accommodated 
three rotation:11 
degrech 
of freedom 
\&I~+ 
were based 
on an Euler angle measurement 
system: 
dorsiflexion-plantarflexion, eversion-inversion, 
and 
abduction-adduction. 
A four camera 
video system 
was 
used 
to record 
all range 
of motion movements. The 
results 
indicated 
that total doriflexion-plantarfexion, eversion-inversion, 
and 
abduction-adduction 
ranges 
of 
motion were not significantly different between 
right and left legs. However, separate 
abduction and 
adduction 
differences 
did occur with the right foot tending to abduct 
more than the left, while the left foot 
tended 
to adduct 
more 
than 
the 
right. These 
differences 
in the abduction 
and 
adduction 
range 
of motion may 
be inherent 
in the measuring 
device. It appears 
that the contralateral 
ankle 
joint complex can be used 
as 
a 
measure 
for establishing 
restoration 
of total motion 
of the 
ankle 
joint complex 
following injury. 
ENHANCED SPINAL FIXATION TO THE PELVIS USING SEGMENTAL INSTRUMENTATION AND A 
NEW SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

A new method for spino-pelvic fixation for segmental 
instrumentation 
was evaluated 
by biomechanical 
testing. The new technique 
uses 
rods with threaded 
L-shaped 
ends, passed 
through the ilium perpendicular 
to 
the axis of the spine at the level of Sl, anterior to the posterior superior iliac spine. The rods were fixed at all 
levels (T8 to L5) using sublaminar 
wires, and the distal threaded 
ends 
were fixed by washers 
and spherical 
nuts 
which allowed the washers 
to seat 
flat against 
the iliac surface. Nine cadaveric 
specimens, 
( T6 to the sacrum 
with intact pelvis) were tested 
on an MTS 858 mechanical 
testing machine; uniaxial compression 
was applied 
in bilateral and unilatera1 
ischial weight-bearing. Specimens 
were tested 
intact, after instrumentation 
with the 
new technique, and after instrumentation 
with the Galveston 
technique. The new technique 
provided greater 
stability than the Galveston 
technique in each loading mode, exhibiting decreased 
overall displacements, 
and 
increased 
axial stiffness. Overall as compared 
directly to the Galveston 
technique, the new method exhibited 
average 
increased 
stiffness 
of 31% for bilateral loading to 222 N, 14% for bilateral loading to 445 N, and 20% 
for unilateral loading to 222 N. 
The new technique 
therefore is biomechanically superior to the Galveston 
technique, 
and eliminates 
the need 
for complex 
three-dimensional 
rod bending 
to conform to the contours 
of the 
iliac wings. The greater stability achieved 
with the technique 
may help to prevent loss of correction of pelvic 
obliquity and rod failure that have 
been 
reported with SSI to the pelvis using the Galveston 
fixation.

to facilitate the analysis 
of X-ray films which are

The mandibular

On a

angle 
between 
the 
posterior

the 
proximal part of the

105’. On the 
skull two processes 
are 
developed: 
the

one, the postglenoid that covers up the proximal l/4 of the condyle.its association with the second process, 
preglenoid, 
prevents 
the 
ventral 
movements

torsion 
of the 
condyle. 
The preglenoid 
process 
prevents

Mink bends 
its head 
on the biting side 
during picking, using 
premollars

moves 
laterally and 
forward to backward. 
Small

Radiography is the Method generally used for the study of postural variations of the spine. To avoid the

method on the kinematics of the spine in anatomical specimen with comparative technique of radiography and 
photography of external markers. 
Five anatomical specimens were studied (donnors between 43 and 90 years). The pelvis is fixed on

With the high cost of routine clinical gait assessments 
it behooves 
us to seek any approach to optimize the use 
of the expensive data collection and analysis systems and the specialized personnel required. 
Except for large 
metropolitan areas it appears uneconomical to have separate laboratories for the assessment 
of amputees, cerebral 
palsy, 
joint arthroplasty, hemiplegia, etc. This paper looks 
at the features that are in common for all such laboratories 
which more than outweighs the lesser differences that may be due to each pathological group. Firstly, the data 
collection systems 
(EMG, force platforms, television, etc.) are virtually the same. The biomechanical models (link 
segment) are the same. All laboratories need similar data bases 
on normals; the only difference could be that some 
labs might only need an adult data base while others might only need childrens. Of extreme importance to the 
diagnostic process 
is the identification of the cause-effect 
relationships between the observed abnormatity and the cause 
(at the motor level). For example, 
stiM 
legged 
weight 
bearing 
is common 
to many 
pathologies 
and 
the possible 
causes 
are 
the same 
for all pathologies. 
Similarly, 
a short

the same 
motor causes 
in amputee 
gait as

INTERPRETATION 
OF 3D MOMENTS-OF-FORCE

Three dimensional 
kinematics 
and kinetics are now becoming feasible with the advent of 
commercially 
available 3D movement analysis systems. The question arises as to whether to report 
kinetic variables such as moments-of-force 
in the local axis system (LAS) or in the global reference 
system (GRS). 
Arguments 
are presented here to support the latter and are based on the task oi 
walking in a plane-of-progression 
and some kinematic observations. The upper body and centre of ma>> 
(COM) 
are tightly regulated to have trajectories 
in the plane-of-progression. 
The COM velocity is 
dominated by its velocity in the plane-of-progression 
and the posture/balance 
of the upper body in both 
the sagittal and frontal planes is dictated by the gravitational 
reference. The lower limb segments even 
when externally rotated during stance do not follow trajectories in their LAS; rather, the thigh and leg 
segments move forward in the plane-of-progression. 
Based on these arguments it makes sense to report 
moments in the GRS (plane-of-progression, 
frontal plane and transverse plane) because we must 
interpret all segment trajectories in terms of the moments that cause those trajectories, and those wo~tld 
have to be in the GRS.

Gait Analysis of Combined Second and Third Toe Transfer

Combined transfer of the second and third toes is to manage the mutilated hand. The purpose of this study 
was to analyze the gait changes of the donor feet of unilateral combined second and third toe transfer. 
From 
Jan. 1983 to July 1991, pre-op. and 6-month post-op. gait study were performed in 15 patients of unilateral 
combined second and third toe transfer were performed. The average age was 36.7 years and male to female ratio 
was 13 : 2. A IO-meter long walkway was used for the gait analysis. Custom-made foot switches were worn 
underneath the soles of the shoes at the region of the big toe, first and fifth metatarsal heads, and the heel. The 
heel switches had a metal tag to allow direct contact with the tape mat for calculating step length and width. The 
foot-ground contact pattern was recorded a self-contained electronic control. One custom-designed transparent 
plate with seven quartz force transducers with minimum resonant frequency of 100-200 Hz, good to detect the 
main responses between the foot and ground during contact. Regional dynamic pressure was captured by a glass 
top force plate with silicon rubber sensor 
pad and video camera. Data were analyzed by a Micro-VAX 
computer. 
At the natural frequency, the cadence (stride/set), walking velocity, step length and width, the percentages 
of stance phase and swing phases, and the single and double support phases were not significantly changed. The 
duration of the heel contact were significantly increased in both non-operated and operated feet. The specific 
regions of fist metatarsal head, the overlapping contact period of 5th and 1st metatarsal heads, were significantly 
shortened. The pressure over the 1st metatarsal head was increased significantly at the operative feet.The pressure 
at the push off phase was significantly decreased 
at the big toe region. 
From these data, the forefoot function was altered and compensated by the heel contact and the push-off 
phases 
was shift partially to the first metatarsal head. 
BONE-ON-BONE 
FORCES AT THE KNEE JOINT DURING WALKING

STAIRCLIMBING

Bone-on-bone force data is important in the study of mechanical factors in the disease process of 
osteoarthritis (OA), and for better fixation designs of joint replacements. It is also important to be able to 
study force data on an individual basis and not just as a group, in order to study disease progress, and the 
effect of therapeutical and surgical treatment. The bone-on-bone forces at the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral 
joint were calculated for nineteen young asymptomatic subjects during walking and stairclimbing. All force 
data were normalized to body mass, and were plotted as a percentage of a walking or stairclimbing cycle. 
Large differences from subject to subject that result in forces between two to five times body weight were 
found. The maximum tibiofemoral compressive forces occur during the push-off phase, where the knee is 
almost fully extended. There are two peaks during stairclimbing that have the same magnitude as the one 
during level walking. One peak is just after initial foot contact and another occurs during the push-off phase. 
The shear forces in the posterior to anterior direction are smaller with values of about half the body weight. 
The large variation in the individual forces underlines the necessity of being able to assess 
these forces 
reliably on an individual basis, in order to study mechanical factors of OA and for clinical assessments.

At the natural frequency, the cadence (stride/set), walking velocity, step length and width, the percentages 
of stance phase and swing phases, and the single and double support phases were not significantly changed. The 
duration of the heel contact were significantly increased in both non-operated and operated feet. The specific 
regions of fist metatarsal head, the overlapping contact period of 5th and 1st metatarsal heads, were significantly 
shortened. The pressure over the 1st metatarsal head was increased significantly at the operative feet.The pressure 
at the push off phase was significantly decreased 
at the big toe region. 
From these data, the forefoot function was altered and compensated by the heel contact and the push-off 
phases 
was shift partially to the first metatarsal head.

Bone-on-bone force data is important in the study of mechanical factors in the disease process of 
osteoarthritis (OA), and for better fixation designs of joint replacements. It is also important to be able to 
study force data on an individual basis and not just as a group, in order to study disease progress, and the 
effect of therapeutical and surgical treatment. The bone-on-bone forces at the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral 
joint were calculated for nineteen young asymptomatic subjects during walking and stairclimbing. All force 
data were normalized to body mass, and were plotted as a percentage of a walking or stairclimbing cycle. 
Large differences from subject to subject that result in forces between two to five times body weight were 
found. The maximum tibiofemoral compressive forces occur during the push-off phase, where the knee is 
almost fully extended. There are two peaks during stairclimbing that have the same magnitude as the one 
during level walking. One peak is just after initial foot contact and another occurs during the push-off phase. 
The shear forces in the posterior to anterior direction are smaller with values of about half the body weight. 
The large variation in the individual forces underlines the necessity of being able to assess 
these forces 
reliably on an individual basis, in order to study mechanical factors of OA and for clinical assessments.

Combined transfer of the second and third toes is to manage the mutilated hand. The purpose of this study 
was to analyze the gait changes of the donor feet of unilateral combined second and third toe transfer. 
From 
Jan. 1983 to July 1991, pre-op. and 6-month post-op. gait study were performed in 15 patients of unilateral 
combined second and third toe transfer were performed. The average age was 36.7 years and male to female ratio 
was 13 : 2. A IO-meter long walkway was used for the gait analysis. Custom-made foot switches were worn 
underneath the soles of the shoes at the region of the big toe, first and fifth metatarsal heads, and the heel. The 
heel switches had a metal tag to allow direct contact with the tape mat for calculating step length and width. The 
foot-ground contact pattern was recorded a self-contained electronic control. One custom-designed transparent 
plate with seven quartz force transducers with minimum resonant frequency of 100-200 Hz, good to detect the 
main responses between the foot and ground during contact. Regional dynamic pressure was captured by a glass 
top force plate with silicon rubber sensor 
pad and video camera. Data were analyzed by a Micro-VAX 
computer. 
At the natural frequency, the cadence (stride/set), walking velocity, step length and width, the percentages 
of stance phase and swing phases, and the single and double support phases were not significantly changed. The 
duration of the heel contact were significantly increased in both non-operated and operated feet. The specific 
regions of fist metatarsal head, the overlapping contact period of 5th and 1st metatarsal heads, were significantly 
shortened. The pressure over the 1st metatarsal head was increased significantly at the operative feet.The pressure 
at the push off phase was significantly decreased 
at the big toe region. 
From these data, the forefoot function was altered and compensated by the heel contact and the push-off 
phases 
was shift partially to the first metatarsal head.

Principal component analysis and clustering procedure were used to reduce the number of redundant 
variables from both static radiograhics measurements obtained by Questor Precision Radiographic technique 
(QPR) and dynamic mechanical factors obtained by a 3-D WATSMART 
optoelectric system (Q-GAIT). The 
dataset contained 58 young and old normal subjects and osteoarthritis patients. The principal component 
method considered eigenvectors with eigenvalues less than 0.7 in turn starting from the smallest, and rejected 
variable that has a largest coefficient in the eigenvector under consideration. The clustering procedure 
performed an oblique rotation on the eigenvectors such that variance accounted for by the cluster components 
were maximized. The iterative procedure stopped once the second eigenvalues for all clusters were less than 
one. For the QPR, both methods retained the same 6 variables from a total of 21 variables, among them there 
were 4 tibial-femoral angles. femoral length, and medial joint space. The variance explained by the two 
methods were 87% and 75% respectively. The results of Q-GAIT were less consistent between the two 
methods. Both methods reduced the Q-GAIT to only 26 variables from a total of 136 variables, and they can 
be further classified into 9 subsets. They belonged to various body forces, moments, and knee angles on a 
3-D planes during a complete gait cycle of level walking. The variance explained by the two methods were 
94% and 76% respectively. This result provides useful information for choosing appropriate biomechanical 
variables in future clinical studies.

AGE-RELATED COMPLIANCE OF THE LAMINA CRIBROSA IN HUMAN EYES 
Julie Albon, Peter 
P. Purslow and

Karwatowski. 
Department 
of Ophthalmology, Bristol Eye Hospital, Bristol and 
Muscle and 
Collagen 
Group, Department 
of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bristol, U.K. 
The lamina cribrosa 
is a membranous 
connective 
tissue 
structure 
in the optic nerve 
head 
and 
is the 
site at which axonal damage 
occurs 
due 
to a backward 
bowing movement 
in the glaucomatous 
process. 
Age is a risk factor in chronic open-angle 
glaucoma 
in which the lamina cribrosa 
becomes 
irreversibly 
deformed. 
We have 
demonstrated 
changes 
with age 
in the 
composition 
of the collagenous 
matrix of the 
lamina cribrosa 
which imply an alteration 
in the mechanical 
properties 
of the lamina cribrosa. 
We have 
therefore 
investigated 
the effect of the mechanical 
behaviour 
of the lamina cribrosa 
as 
a function of age. 
Pressure-volume 
xelatidnships 
were 
measured 
by observing 
the 
deformation of the lamina cribrosa 
created 
by increasing 
and 
decreasing 
increments 
of intraocular 
pressure. 
Deformations were 
obsuved by 
3-D optical imaging of the fluorescently labelled 
lamina cribrosa 
by scanning 
confocal microscopy. 
The 
greatest 
compliance 
was 
demonstrated 
in the 
youngest 
lamina cribrosa, 
which also 
demonstrated 
the 
greatest 
resilience. 
The decreased 
compliance 
and 
resilience 
of older tissue 
may be 
responsible 
for the 
predisposition 
to glaucomatous 
damage 
seen 
in elderly eyes.

inertial characteristics of endoskeletal and exoskeletal transfemoral (TF) prosthetic limbs were 
determined by standard physical methods and characterisbics 
of TF amputation stumps were determined using a 
geometric model based on anthropometric and socket measurements. The results of the study demonstrated clear 
differences between shank/foot segments of endoskeletal and 
exoskeletal prostheses but little difference between 
thigh (stumplsocket) segments. The inertial characteristics and centre of mass (CM) locations of the segments of 
transfemoral prostheses differed substantially from those of a normal lower limb. The prosthetic thigh segments 
measured less than 70% of the mass of a normal segment. Centres of mass were substantially more d&al and the 
radii of gyration about the CM were substantially smaller. For the prosthetic shank/foot segments, similar 
differences were observed: the prosthetic segments had substantially less mass and substantially more distal CM 
locations but had similar radii of gyration. Estimates of the half periods of oscillation of the shank/foot only and 
of the total lower limb with the knee extended were made based on the measures obtained. The estimated half 
periods of oscillation for the shank/foot were increased by 7% to 8% compared 10 normal limbs but the half 
periods for the total prosthetic limb were decreased by 2% to 5% depending on proetheeis type. Furthermore, 
despite large apparent differences in mass and mass distribution, the endoskeletal and exoskeletal limbs had half 
periods 
which were very similar. 
These results suggest 
that differences in TF prosthetic limb inertial 
characteristics account only in part for the increased prosthetic swing phase duration observed in transfemcral 
amputee gait.

AGE-RELATED COMPLIANCE OF THE LAMINA CRIBROSA IN HUMAN EYES

The lamina cribrosa 
is a membranous 
connective 
tissue 
structure 
in the optic nerve 
head 
and 
is the 
site at which axonal damage 
occurs 
due 
to a backward 
bowing movement 
in the glaucomatous 
process. 
Age is a risk factor in chronic open-angle 
glaucoma 
in which the lamina cribrosa 
becomes 
irreversibly 
deformed. 
We have 
demonstrated 
changes 
with age 
in the 
composition 
of the collagenous 
matrix of the 
lamina cribrosa 
which imply an alteration 
in the mechanical 
properties 
of the lamina cribrosa. 
We have 
therefore 
investigated 
the effect of the mechanical 
behaviour 
of the lamina cribrosa 
as 
a function of age. 
Pressure-volume 
xelatidnships 
were 
measured 
by observing 
the 
deformation of the lamina cribrosa 
created 
by increasing 
and 
decreasing 
increments 
of intraocular 
pressure. 
Deformations were 
obsuved by 
3-D optical imaging of the fluorescently labelled 
lamina cribrosa 
by scanning 
confocal microscopy. 
The 
greatest 
compliance 
was 
demonstrated 
in the 
youngest 
lamina cribrosa, 
which also 
demonstrated 
the 
greatest 
resilience. 
The decreased 
compliance 
and 
resilience 
of older tissue 
may be 
responsible 
for the 
predisposition 
to glaucomatous 
damage 
seen 
in elderly eyes.

A BIOMBCHANICAL 
ANALYSIS 
OF PATELLOFBMORAL 
BRACING 
Anita Bagley, MS. 
Orthopedic Biomecbanics Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA 
A prototype knee brace designed to alleviate patellofemoral pain by restricting lateral deviation of the patella 
and by preventing hyperextension of the knee was evaluated functionally during tasks of level walking, stair climbing 
and stair descent. Eleven individuals (20 to 44 y.o.) participated, including five patients diagnosed with pat&r 
malaligument and six controls. Knee range of motion during the tasks was collected with a video based 
motion analysis 
system. Subjects were tested without the brace and with the brace set with a 10, 25 or 35 degree extension stop in 
random order. No significant difference existed between patient and control heel strike knee extension during treadmill 
walking. The use of the brace reduced maximum knee extension for both groups (pc.05 for the 10 and 35 degree 
stop; 
pc.09 for the 25 degree 
stop) but only in the final 10 degrees 
of extension; the reduction in knee extension did not vary 
significantly between brace stop setting. In the stair tasks, the patient group demonstrated greater knez extension than 
the control group (pc.05) at weight transfer. Use of the brace bad no significant effect on maximum knee extension 
for either group. Patients may extend their knee regardless of task or presence 
of the brace in order to avoid patellar 
compression and pain resulting from quadriceps activation during knee flexion. The potential for eventual development 
of osteoarthritic changes due to inappropriate joint loading associated with this extended stance, and the potential for 
patella subluxation in this position are indicated, but the magnitude of the risks are currently unresolved. 
FRICTION 
AND WEAR OF CARTILAGE

Griffiths 
(University 
of 
Western 
Australia) 
and 
A.W. Batchelor 
(Nanyang 
Technological 
University, 
Singapore). 
Wear and friction 
tests of rat femur 
cartilage 
sliding 
against 
a steel disc under 
dry 
conditions 
and irrigation 
by both saline solution 
and synovial 
fluid were conducted 
on pin- 
on-disc apparatus. 
Tests under dry conditions 
and irrigation 
by saline solution 
revealed an 
initial 
period of low friction 
which depends on the survival 
of a thin surface film or layer. 
The surface layers were found to be surprisingly 
durable which suggests that synovial joints 
can withstand 
considerable 
cartilage contact without 
ill effect. Persistence of low friction 
was 
observed 
to correspond 
to negligible 
damage 
by wear to the cartilage 
surface 
while 
a 
transition 
of high friction 
was related to removal by wear of the cartilage surface layers. In 
tests conducted 
with synovial 
fluid 
extremely 
low friction 
coefficient 
was observed 
at the 
onset of sliding 
between 
cartilage 
and disc. The initial 
low friction 
coefficient 
was not 
permanent 
and was followed 
by a change to higher friction. 
The effect of temperature 
on 
cartilage friction 
when irrigated 
by synovial 
fluid was very strong. The lubricating 
capacity 
of synovial 
fluid 
was significantly 
impaired 
by sliding 
temperatures 
which 
were less than 
body core temperature. 
GAIT CHARACTERISTICS

Following malleolar fractures the restoration of normal foot function is attempted by reconstruction of 
the ankle mortise and the ligamentous structures. The objective of the present study was to investigate the foot 
function of patients after ankle fractures in comparison with normal controls and to reveal possible changes of 
foot loading patterns. 41 patients with malleolar fractures were studied 6 to 48 months (mean of 27 months) 
tribution platform (EMED SF, novel company, Munich). A group of 100 normal subiects from the same armv 
population was used for comparison. Fiveiaii measurements-at 
a-freely-chosen speed-were 
collected from each 
foot. In eight plantar regions the peak pressure and relative impulse. values were determined and averaged 
across 
five trials: Central, medial and lateral heel (CH, MH, LH), midfoot (MF), lst, 2nd/3rd and 5th metatarsal 
head (Ml, M2/3, M5) and hallux (H). The comparison of the patients’ healthy and injured feet showed a fairly 
symmetric distribution of maximum messures and relative imoulses in the hind foot and midfoot. Concerning 
the forefoot, slightly higher pressure 
and impulse values were &en in the lateral parts of the injured foot (Msjq 
M5) whereas in the medial regions (M 1, H) lower values could be found. The comoarison between the control 
group and the injured feet shiwed that the peak pressure values in the injured fe’et were significantly lowcr 
(p<O.O5) 
in the medial heel (-11%) and the three metatarsal regions (Ml -19%, M2/3 -19%, M5 -27%). The 
relative impulses in the operated feet were significantly reduced in the three hind foot regions (CH -8%, MH 
-21%, LH -16%) and increased in the hallux (+45%/u). 
Even though these findings may partly bc due to the

A prototype knee brace designed to alleviate patellofemoral pain by restricting lateral deviation of the patella 
and by preventing hyperextension of the knee was evaluated functionally during tasks of level walking, stair climbing 
and stair descent. Eleven individuals (20 to 44 y.o.) participated, including five patients diagnosed with pat&r 
malaligument and six controls. Knee range of motion during the tasks was collected with a video based 
motion analysis 
system. Subjects were tested without the brace and with the brace set with a 10, 25 or 35 degree extension stop in 
random order. No significant difference existed between patient and control heel strike knee extension during treadmill 
walking. The use of the brace reduced maximum knee extension for both groups (pc.05 for the 10 and 35 degree 
stop; 
pc.09 for the 25 degree 
stop) but only in the final 10 degrees 
of extension; the reduction in knee extension did not vary 
significantly between brace stop setting. In the stair tasks, the patient group demonstrated greater knez extension than 
the control group (pc.05) at weight transfer. Use of the brace bad no significant effect on maximum knee extension 
for either group. Patients may extend their knee regardless of task or presence 
of the brace in order to avoid patellar 
compression and pain resulting from quadriceps activation during knee flexion. The potential for eventual development 
of osteoarthritic changes due to inappropriate joint loading associated with this extended stance, and the potential for 
patella subluxation in this position are indicated, but the magnitude of the risks are currently unresolved.

conditions 
and irrigation 
by both saline solution 
and synovial

on pin-

Tests under dry conditions

by saline solution 
revealed an 
initial 
period of low friction 
which depends on the survival 
of a thin surface film or layer. 
The surface layers were found to be surprisingly 
durable which suggests that synovial joints 
can withstand 
considerable 
cartilage contact without 
ill effect. Persistence of low friction 
was 
observed 
to correspond 
to negligible 
damage 
by wear to the cartilage 
surface 
while 
a 
transition 
of high friction 
was related to removal by wear of the cartilage surface layers. In 
tests conducted 
with synovial 
fluid 
extremely 
low friction 
coefficient 
was observed 
at the 
onset of sliding 
between 
cartilage

low friction 
coefficient 
was not 
permanent 
and was followed 
by a change to higher friction. 
The effect of temperature 
on 
cartilage friction 
when irrigated 
by synovial 
fluid was very strong. The lubricating 
capacity 
of synovial

was significantly 
impaired

Following malleolar fractures the restoration of normal foot function is attempted by reconstruction of 
the ankle mortise and the ligamentous structures. The objective of the present study was to investigate the foot 
function of patients after ankle fractures in comparison with normal controls and to reveal possible changes of 
foot loading patterns. 41 patients with malleolar fractures were studied 6 to 48 months (mean of 27 months) 
tribution platform (EMED SF, novel company, Munich). A group of 100 normal subiects from the same armv 
population was used for comparison. Fiveiaii measurements-at 
a-freely-chosen speed-were 
collected from each 
foot. In eight plantar regions the peak pressure and relative impulse. values were determined and averaged 
across 
five trials: Central, medial and lateral heel (CH, MH, LH), midfoot (MF), lst, 2nd/3rd and 5th metatarsal 
head (Ml, M2/3, M5) and hallux (H). The comparison of the patients’ healthy and injured feet showed a fairly 
symmetric distribution of maximum messures and relative imoulses in the hind foot and midfoot. Concerning 
the forefoot, slightly higher pressure 
and impulse values were &en in the lateral parts of the injured foot (Msjq 
M5) whereas in the medial regions (M 1, H) lower values could be found. The comoarison between the control 
group and the injured feet shiwed that the peak pressure values in the injured fe’et were significantly lowcr 
(p<O.O5) 
in the medial heel (-11%) and the three metatarsal regions (Ml -19%, M2/3 -19%, M5 -27%). The 
relative impulses in the operated feet were significantly reduced in the three hind foot regions (CH -8%, MH 
-21%, LH -16%) and increased in the hallux (+45%/u). 
Even though these findings may partly bc due to the 
smaller strides used by the patients, the reduction in hind foot loading might also indicate a persisting 
avoidance pattern whereby the patients try to prcvcnt an overloading of the previously injured foot.

THE EFFECT OF MASS ON THE KINEMATICS OF STEADY STATE WHEELCHAIR 
PROPULSION IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY 
Janet H. Bednarczyk, David J. Sanderson 
British Columbia Rehabilitation Society, UBC Biomechanics Laboratory, 
Vancouver, B.C. CANADA 
A recent trend in wheelchair design has been the reduction in the mass of wheelchairs. The 
purpose of this study was to examine the effect of mass on the 3D kinematics of wheelchair 
propulsion. The mass of test chairs (9.3 kg) was manipulated by mass additions (5 and 10 kg) in two, 
neurologically matched, groups (n=lO) of adults and children with uncomplicated spinal cord injury. 
The average mass and age of the pediatric group was much smaller than the adult group (37.4 kg 
and 11.3 years vs 68.5 kg and 33.5 years). The averaged group wheeling velocities were 2.26 m/set 
(pediatric) and 2.38 m/set (adult) and were significantly different (~~0.05). The two groups spent 
comparable proportions of the wheeling cycle in propulsion (pediatric = 24.45 %, adult = 24.41 %). 
An ANCOVA of the angular data, with wheeling velocity as the covariate, showed significant 
differences for three (elbow, shoulder, and shoulder abduction) of the four angular parameters and 
nonsignificant groups-by-conditions effects indicating that there were significant differences between 
?he 
two groups but that the group responses to the test conditions were similar. These results, based 
on a sample of chairs and subjects, indicate that neither the test chairs nor the mass additions had an 
effect on the angular kinematics, % propulsion or wheeling velocities of two groups of subjects with 
spinal cord injury in short distance, level wheelchair propulsion.

A clinical study of medial malleolar fractures treated by fixation with L-polylactic acid screws was 
performed after a series of preliminary laboratory tests. The screws have an external diameter of 6.2 mm. 
Their resistence under torsion is 1.6 N/m. while the resistance under traction is 880 N. 
Up to June 1992, 10 polylactic acid screws were implanted in 9 patients (2 screws in one patient) with 
age ranging from 18 to 80 years (average 41). The only selection of the patients was based on the size of the 
malleolar fragment. The post-operative care was the same usually adopted after conventional fixation. Healing 
occurred after two months in all the cases. There were no complications, and particularly we never observed 
the phenomenon of non-septic sinus draining that was reported to occur in about 8% of the patients treated 
with polyglycolide or lactide-glycolyde rods by Bostman et al. 
The use of reabsorbable materials for the fixation of fractures would allow to overcome the problems 
of metal corrosion and the rare cases 
of allergic reactions to metals, but most important of all, it would abolish 
the need for a second operation to remove the materials, and inherent complications. The biomechanic features 
of reabsorbable materials up to now, however, are far inferior to those of conventional materials. The main 
scope of this clinical trial was to achieve a basic, preliminary experience in the use of reabsorbable systems, in 
order to become able in the future to develope more complex and stron

THE EFFECT OF MASS ON THE KINEMATICS OF STEADY STATE WHEELCHAIR 
PROPULSION IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY 
Janet H. Bednarczyk, David J. Sanderson

Vancouver, B.C. CANADA 
A recent trend in wheelchair design has been the reduction in the mass of wheelchairs. The 
purpose of this study was to examine the effect of mass on the 3D kinematics of wheelchair 
propulsion. The mass of test chairs (9.3 kg) was manipulated by mass additions (5 and 10 kg) in two, 
neurologically matched, groups (n=lO) of adults and children with uncomplicated spinal cord injury. 
The average mass and age of the pediatric group was much smaller than the adult group (37.4 kg 
and 11.3 years vs 68.5 kg and 33.5 years). The averaged group wheeling velocities were 2.26 m/set 
(pediatric) and 2.38 m/set (adult) and were significantly different (~~0.05). The two groups spent 
comparable proportions of the wheeling cycle in propulsion (pediatric = 24.45 %, adult = 24.41 %). 
An ANCOVA of the angular data, with wheeling velocity as the covariate, showed significant 
differences for three (elbow, shoulder, and shoulder abduction) of the four angular parameters and 
nonsignificant groups-by-conditions effects indicating that there were significant differences between 
?he 
two groups but that the group responses to the test conditions were similar. These results, based 
on a sample of chairs and subjects, indicate that neither the test chairs nor the mass additions had an 
effect on the angular kinematics, % propulsion or wheeling velocities of two groups of subjects with 
spinal cord injury in short distance, level wheelchair propulsion.

is 
of

in 
the

of 
the

were being 
estimated 
during 
the 
lengthening 
of 
the

FIXATION 
OF MEDIAL 
MALLEOLAR 
FRACTURES WITH REABSORBABLE 
POLYLACTIC 
ACID 
SCREWS 
G. Bettelli, A. Ferruzzi, M. Messori and G. Gualtieri 
Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, 4th Orthopaedic Division, and Officine Ortopediche Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy. 
A clinical study of medial malleolar fractures treated by fixation with L-polylactic acid screws was 
performed after a series of preliminary laboratory tests. The screws have an external diameter of 6.2 mm. 
Their resistence under torsion is 1.6 N/m. while the resistance under traction is 880 N. 
Up to June 1992, 10 polylactic acid screws were implanted in 9 patients (2 screws in one patient) with 
age ranging from 18 to 80 years (average 41). The only selection of the patients was based on the size of the 
malleolar fragment. The post-operative care was the same usually adopted after conventional fixation. Healing 
occurred after two months in all the cases. There were no complications, and particularly we never observed 
the phenomenon of non-septic sinus draining that was reported to occur in about 8% of the patients treated 
with polyglycolide or lactide-glycolyde rods by Bostman et al. 
The use of reabsorbable materials for the fixation of fractures would allow to overcome the problems 
of metal corrosion and the rare cases 
of allergic reactions to metals, but most important of all, it would abolish 
the need for a second operation to remove the materials, and inherent complications. The biomechanic features 
of reabsorbable materials up to now, however, are far inferior to those of conventional materials. The main 
scope of this clinical trial was to achieve a basic, preliminary experience in the use of reabsorbable systems, in 
order to become able in the future to develope more complex and stron 
substitute the conventional means in a wider range of conditions.

Abnormal loading 
patterns 
of the 
tibia may be 
responsible 
for tibia1 
stress 
fractures, 
which is a 
common 
injury in 
long distance 
runners. 
The stresses 
in the tibia for a specific 
runner 
are 
the 
combined 
result of running style, ankle 
joint anatomy, 
and 
geometry 
of the bone. 
A method 
was 
developed 
to estimate 
stresses 
during running, 
incorporating 
all three 
subject-specific 
factors. 
External 
forces 
and 
kinematics 
were 
measured 
in one 
male 
subject, 
at 
a speed 
of 4 m/s. 
The ankle 
joint complex was 
modelled 
as 
two hinge 
joints, stabilized 
by four functional muscle 
groups. 
This model was 
used 
to calculate 
the 
total force and 
moment 
transmitted 
to the 
distal tibia. The geometry 
of 
the 
distal half of the 
tibia was 
obtained 
from MRI scans, 
and 
a beam 
model 
was 
used 
to estimate 
the stress 
distribution along the 
perimeter 
of the bone. 
The forces 
acting on the tibia were 
dominated 
by an 
axial compression 
of about 
6 times 
body weight. Moments 
were 
mainly bending 
about 
the anterior-posterior 
axes, 
and 
torsion about 
the long axis (about lo-30 Nm each). 
The 
resulting 
peak 
normal and 
shear 
stresses 
at the midhaft of the tibia were 
25 Mpa and 
3 MPa respectively 
during 
walking , and 
60 and 
2.5 MPa during running. These 
values 
are 
considerably 
higher 
than 
were 
previously found 
using 
strain 
gauge 
measurements 
(D.R. Carter, 
J. Biomech. 11:199-202, 
1978). 
The 
discrepancies 
can 
partly be 
explained 
by a difference 
in running speed 
and 
by placement 
of the strain 
gauge. 
This modelling approach 
could 
eventually 
lead 
to a non-invasive 
assessment 
of risk for tibial stress 
fractures 
in individual runners.

Confluency 
was 
obtained 
after 15 
days. 
No cellular mortality has 
been 
observed 
with TA6V but on CrCo, 10% 
of cells have 
died. 
On both alloys, the cells showed 
a strong 
tendancy 
to adhere

with the sand-blasting 
treatment 
The 
cytocompatibility of TA6V was

Driving-point 
mechanical impedance techniques can be used to detect changes in 
cortical bone during the post fracture healing process. 
The resonance frequency under 
transverse excitation was chosen as the figure of merit in determining the degree of healing. 
Fractures were induced in the ulnas of two research canines. In each canine, one ulna was 
used ans the control limb and the other had a surgically induced fracture (osteotomy). The 
fractures were monitored weekly, using radiographic 
and vibration 
analysis techniques for 
a period of up to twenty weeks. The resonance frequency values were found to show a 
significant 
variation between weekly measurements and an increasing trend as the healing 
process progressed. 
A model was developed using finite element analysis to confirm the 
increase in resonance frequency as the fracture healed.

FINGER INTRINSIC MUSCLE DEFICIENCY: BIOMECHANICAL 
EVALUATIONS OF FUNCTIONAL REHABILITATIVE 
INTERVENTIONS

A correct balance 
between 
intrinsic and 
extrinsic 
muscles 
is a tindamental factor for the versatility and 
the 
power of the hand. 
If the function of the finger intrinsic muscles 
is lost, the hand 
becomes 
weak, awkward, and 
deformed. Many kinds of surgical interventions can be performed on the hand to recover its mechanical 
fhnctionality .It is then 
profitable 
to develop 
tools for an 
objective 
preventive 
evaluation 
of interventions 
In order to analyse 
the effects 
of the intrinsic muscles 
deficiency 
and 
of few widely adopted 
surgical 
interventions, 
“tip pinch” and “grasp” loading conditions have 
been 
tested: 
maximum 
force exertable 
by the finger and tendon 
tensions 
have 
been 
calculated. 
A recently 
developed 
model of the finger tendon complex 
(Casolo, 
Lorenzi 1993) 
has been adopted; it consists of four bodies kinematic chain, four d.o.f., seven tendons with some 
interconnections. 
The few experimental 
data available 
in literature on normal finger strength 
have been 
used for the preliminary 
validation 
of the model; 
finther experimental 
validation 
are 
in progress. 
The output diagrams 
show, for instance, 
that: for a given position the analysed 
tendon 
transfer 
techniques, 
which 
can 
replace 
the active control of finger position, can 
restore 
a good grasp 
while the maximum 
pinch force remains 
low. Moreover, the optimal distribution of forces 
in order to obtain maximum 
grasp 
appears 
strongly dependent 
on the chosen 
intervention.

The design of a lower limb ortbosis requires as an input an accurate estimate of the loads that will be applied to the orthosis 
during its daily use. On the basis of reliable loading estimates 
the designers 
will be able to chose the 
materials and determine its 
optimal distribution in order to obtain a lightweight orthosis that will safely meet the mechanical and functional specifications. In 
the present study the moment at ankle and metatarsophalangeal 
joints were estimated by means of the projected GRF vector in 
order to describe the loads in normal joints during walking. Purpose of the study was the collection of a data base of normal 
subjects in the age range of child pathologies and the 
study of the correlations between joint moments and some anthropometric 
parameters aimed at the optimization of the design process. Fourtyfve normal subjects 
were tested: the age range of population 
tested was 4-18 years. Kinematics analpis of the lower limb joint joints was performed by means of an optoelectronic motion 
analysis 
system; 
dynamic data were collected by means 
of a piezoelectric force platform. Statistical analysis 
was used to determine

A correct balance 
between 
intrinsic and 
extrinsic 
muscles 
is a tindamental factor for the versatility and 
the 
power of the hand. 
If the function of the finger intrinsic muscles 
is lost, the hand 
becomes 
weak, awkward, and 
deformed. Many kinds of surgical interventions can be performed on the hand to recover its mechanical 
fhnctionality .It is then 
profitable 
to develop 
tools for an 
objective 
preventive 
evaluation 
of interventions 
In order to analyse 
the effects 
of the intrinsic muscles 
deficiency 
and 
of few widely adopted 
surgical 
interventions, 
“tip pinch” and “grasp” loading conditions have 
been 
tested: 
maximum 
force exertable 
by the finger and tendon 
tensions 
have 
been 
calculated. 
A recently 
developed 
model of the finger tendon complex 
(Casolo, 
Lorenzi 1993) 
has been adopted; it consists of four bodies kinematic chain, four d.o.f., seven tendons with some 
interconnections. 
The few experimental 
data available 
in literature on normal finger strength 
have been 
used for the preliminary 
validation 
of the model; 
finther experimental 
validation 
are 
in progress. 
The output diagrams 
show, for instance, 
that: for a given position the analysed 
tendon 
transfer 
techniques, 
which 
can 
replace 
the active control of finger position, can 
restore 
a good grasp 
while the maximum 
pinch force remains 
low. Moreover, the optimal distribution of forces 
in order to obtain maximum 
grasp 
appears 
strongly dependent 
on the chosen 
intervention.

The design of a lower limb ortbosis requires as an input an accurate estimate of the loads that will be applied to the orthosis 
during its daily use. On the basis of reliable loading estimates 
the designers 
will be able to chose the 
materials and determine its 
optimal distribution in order to obtain a lightweight orthosis that will safely meet the mechanical and functional specifications. In 
the present study the moment at ankle and metatarsophalangeal 
joints were estimated by means of the projected GRF vector in 
order to describe the loads in normal joints during walking. Purpose of the study was the collection of a data base of normal 
subjects in the age range of child pathologies and the 
study of the correlations between joint moments and some anthropometric 
parameters aimed at the optimization of the design process. Fourtyfve normal subjects 
were tested: the age range of population 
tested was 4-18 years. Kinematics analpis of the lower limb joint joints was performed by means of an optoelectronic motion 
analysis 
system; 
dynamic data were collected by means 
of a piezoelectric force platform. Statistical analysis 
was used to determine 
equations for the prediction of the dorsifIexion moment at ankle (DTT), dorsifIexion (DMF) and plantarflexion moments at 
metatarsophalangeal (PMF) joints. The equations derived are the following:

Isolated from adult horses were used. Loads were mesured by a 2000

strain gauge load cell. Colored head needles were pinned at different 
levels along the 
tendon, 
in order to isolate 
macroscoprcally 
homogeneous 
se ments. 
Each test

measured on the video recordings, 
were”used 
to calculate’the 
strain of each tendinous 
segment, 
whose cross section 
was determined 
before 
by ultrasonography. 
The latter 
was used for further 
computing 
the local stress at rupture. 
The modulus of elasticity 
(E) was calculated 
from a least squares linear approximation 
of the stress-strain 
curve 
thus determined 
for each tendinous 
segment. 
After the test, an histologic 
examination 
was systematically 
performed. 
On normal 
flexor 
tendons, 
E was mrnimum

THE EFFECTS 
OF VALGUS BRACING ON THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL KINEMATICS OF GAIT IN A

BC, Canada. 
This study 
was 
designed 
to test 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
knee 
brace 
alters 
the 
alignment 
of the 
shank 
segment 
with respect 
to the 
thigh segment. 
A single 
subject 
(a 
57 year 
old male 
diagnosed 
with medial 
compartment 
osteoarthritis 
of the 
left knee) 
was 
prescribed 
a valgus 
knee 
brace 
that had 
been 
worn for the 
previous 
8 months 
on a 
daily basis. 
While he 
reported 
pain relief with the 
brace 
the 
mechanism 
has 
not been 
identified. 
Kinematic 
data 
of the 
lower limb were 
collected 
while the 
subject 
walked 
on a 
treadmill 
at a walking 
speed 
of 2.3 
m/s. 
A total of five reflective 
markers 
were 
placed 
on the 
thigh and 
shank 
segments 
of the 
left leg and 
used 
to compute 
the 
3D coordinates 
of the 
leg segments. 
The subject 
walked 
on the 
treadmill without the 
brace 
and 
then 
with the 
brace. 
The 
data 
showed 
that 
during 
the stance 
phase 
there 
was 
a marked 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
conditions 
just after 
heel 
strike 
such 
that 
the 
knee 
joint was 
in varus 
for the 
no-brace 
condition while the 
knee joint 
was 
in valgus 
for the 
brace 
condition. 
Maquet 
(1984) 
argued 
that 
a valgus 
orientation 
is believed 
to indicate 
a shift 
in the 
centre 
of joint pressure 
toward 
the 
lateral 
side 
of the 
joint and 
consequently 
reduces 
the 
load 
on the 
afflicted 
medial 
compartment. 
This study 
does 
indicate 
that 
the 
brace 
does 
change 
the 
giut of this 
particular 
subject 
and 
the 
change 
may 
explain 
his pain 
relief. An expanded 
study 
is currently 
underway 
to test 
where 
these 
results 
are 
generalizable.

The biomechanical properties of brachial plexus are still under debate. This study was designed to measure. 
the 
in-situ tension 
stress 
inducing 
functional failure of brachial 
plexus. The methods 
employed 
in this study consist 
of two steps.Step 
1 (in vivo): The 
brachial 
plexus 
of seven 
Japanese 
white rabbits 
were 
surgically 
exposed 
under 
intravenous 
anesthesia. 
A bipolar stimulating 
cuff electrode 
was placed 
proximal on the lower trunks, while a 
recording 
electrode 
was placed 
on the triceps. 
Each 
rabbit bra&al plexus was stretched 
laterally 
by a Shimazu 
Autograph 
500B at a rate of 10 mm per minute up to elecnophisiological 
failure to conduct The distance 
between 
two marks placed on the lower trunks was simultaneously 
recorded with a video dimensional 
analysis 
( VDA) 
system. 
This measurement 
was 
very useful to determine 
the 
change 
in in-situ nerve 
strain.Step 
2 
(in vitro): Bach 
rabbit was then 
sacriticed, 
the 
lower trunks was 
removed 
out. The specimen 
was then loaded 
in 
tension 
at 
a 
rate 
of 10 mm per minute 
and 
the nerve 
tension 
was 
recorded. 
The. 
load 
at 
complete 
conduction 
block 
was 
determined 
by the 
load-%elongation 
curve 
obtained 
from step 
2. 
In results, the 
in-situ nerve 
strain 
prior to nerve 
stretch 
was 
found to be 
-3.8 
+ 1.2%. When 
the compound 
muscle 
action 
potential 
was not evoked, 
the 
in-situ nerve 
strain 
was 
found to be 8.5 
20.8%. The 
in-situ load 
and 
stress 
at complete 
conduction 
block were found to be 
2.6 f OSN and 
0.96 + 0.2MPa, respectively. 
This study 
should 
be 
helpful in understanding 
the 
mechanism 
of brachial 
plexus 
stretch 
injury.

This study 
was 
designed 
to test 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
knee 
brace 
alters 
the 
alignment 
of the 
shank 
segment 
with respect 
to the 
thigh segment. 
A single 
subject 
(a 
57 year 
old male 
diagnosed 
with medial 
compartment 
osteoarthritis 
of the 
left knee) 
was 
prescribed 
a valgus 
knee 
brace 
that had 
been 
worn for the 
previous 
8 months 
on a 
daily basis. 
While he 
reported 
pain relief with the 
brace 
the 
mechanism 
has 
not been 
identified. 
Kinematic 
data 
of the 
lower limb were 
collected 
while the 
subject 
walked 
on a 
treadmill 
at a walking 
speed 
of 2.3 
m/s. 
A total of five reflective 
markers 
were 
placed 
on the 
thigh and 
shank 
segments 
of the 
left leg and 
used 
to compute 
the 
3D coordinates 
of the 
leg segments. 
The subject 
walked 
on the 
treadmill without the 
brace 
and 
then 
with the 
brace. 
The 
data 
showed 
that 
during 
the stance 
phase 
there 
was 
a marked 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
conditions 
just after 
heel

that 
the 
knee 
joint was 
in varus 
for the 
no-brace 
condition while the 
knee joint 
was 
in valgus 
for the 
brace 
condition. 
Maquet 
(1984) 
argued 
that 
a valgus 
orientation 
is believed 
to indicate 
a shift 
in the 
centre 
of joint pressure 
toward 
the 
lateral 
side 
of the 
joint and 
consequently 
reduces 
the 
load 
on the 
afflicted 
medial 
compartment. 
This study 
does 
indicate 
that 
the 
brace 
does 
change

the

employed 
in this study consist 
of two steps.Step 
1 (in vivo): The 
brachial 
plexus 
of seven 
Japanese 
white rabbits 
were 
surgically 
exposed 
under 
intravenous 
anesthesia. 
A bipolar stimulating 
cuff electrode 
was placed 
proximal on the lower trunks, while a 
recording 
electrode 
was placed 
on the triceps. 
Each 
rabbit bra&al plexus was stretched 
laterally 
by a Shimazu 
Autograph 
500B at a rate of 10 mm per minute up to elecnophisiological 
failure to conduct The distance 
between 
two marks placed on the lower trunks was simultaneously 
recorded with a video dimensional 
analysis 
( VDA) 
system. 
This measurement 
was 
very useful to determine 
the 
change 
in in-situ nerve 
strain.Step 
2 
(in vitro): Bach 
rabbit was then 
sacriticed, 
the 
lower trunks was 
removed 
out. The specimen 
was then loaded 
in 
tension 
at 
a 
rate 
of 10 mm per minute 
and 
the nerve 
tension 
was 
recorded. 
The. 
load 
at 
complete 
conduction 
block 
was 
determined 
by the 
load-%elongation 
curve 
obtained 
from step 
2. 
In results, the 
in-situ nerve 
strain 
prior to nerve 
stretch 
was 
found to be 
-3.8 
+ 1.2%. When 
the compound 
muscle 
action 
potential 
was not evoked, 
the 
in-situ nerve 
strain 
was 
found to be 8.5

in-situ load 
and 
stress 
at complete 
conduction 
block were found to be 
2.6 f OSN and 
0.96 + 0.2MPa, respectively.

The aim of this work is to determine the mechanical properties of a new highly purified bone 
xenograft (T650 prepared by TR4NSPHYTO 
S.A) derived from calf cancellous bone according to different 
immersion procedures. The T650 samples were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (n=19) immersed 
in human titrated blood, group 2 (n=26) in physiologic saline, group 3 (n=29) in a 40% (V/V) glycerin 
solution in water, 30 minutes prior to testing. Compressive tests were performed using a model HlOFM 
HOUNSFIELD 
material testing machine at room temperature (2OtiO). The force was applied on the right 
angle on the upper face of bone (25* 15 mm). The tests were performed at constant deformation rate of 0.01 
mm.min” 
. Destructive testing was preceded by a series of 10 conditioning 
cycles (0.1 Hz) to an infra- 
maximal stress (1.3 MPa). There is no significant difference in apparent density and Young’s modulus. 
Ultimate stress is different for the 3 groups (PC O.Ol), specially between groups 2 and 3. The main effect 
of hydration 
concerns the ultimate strain. Immersion in physiologic saline induces an important water 
absorption by collagen. In regards of the importance of ultimate strain of grafts for surgeon an immersion 
in the patient’s blood must be considered as the most appropriate technique.

Wear is one of the main surface 
failure 
mechanism in materials 
and it 
will 
play a 
leading 
role 
in substitutive 
dental 
bicmaterials. 
The aim of the present 
study is to compare 
the abrasive 
wear of different 
metallic 
materials 
used in dental 
applications. 
The study has been carried 
out according 
to the DIN 53516 standard 
for abrasive 
wear 
using 
a crossed-cylinder 
apparatus. 
The linear 
speed used has been 0.3 m/s which is low 
enough in order 
to avoid 
fusion 
and oxidative 
wear. The load used has been 1 Kg which is 
also 
low in order 
to avoid 
feezing 
wear. The measured wear is only abrasive. 
The samples 
used were cylinders 
of 15.4 ~TI diameter 
and 7 mn height. 
The weight 
loss has been evaluated 
and different 
testing 
times: 
10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 
60 minutes. 
Using the density 
of each material 
the values 
of volume loss required 
by the 
DIN 53516 standard 
have been evaluated. 
It can be noticed 
that 
the volume loss is linear 
with 
testing 
time. 
The prsent 
results 
show that 
the abrasive 
wear of alloys 
based on precious 
metals 
such 
as Pt, Pd, Au and Ag is higher 
than for Ti and Ti based alloys. 
The alloy 
with 
highest 
wear 
resistance 
is the Co-Cr which exhibits 
as well 
as the highest 
hardness and Younq*s modulus.

Restoration of walking in paraplegic patients is a complex task. Although good results have recently 
been achieved with new ot-thoses for reciprocal gait, further improvements must be performed in terms of 
optimal adaptation to the single subject and choice of the best locomotor strategy. Attempting to face these 
problems in the present study a group of paraplegic patients walking with RGO orthosis and upper limb aids has 
been assessed with a multifactorial movement analysis system consisting on an ELITE system for kinematic 
analysis, a force platform for Ground Reaction Force (GRF) detection and a PC to store, process and graphically 
represent all data collected during movement. A couple of TV cameras were used for each side of the patient to 
allow a 3D analysis of orthosis, pelvis, upper limbs, arm aids and head. Besides a general description of walking 
pattern, the differences between the use of crutches and walking frame were investigated. General spatio- 
temporal parameter of gait and time course of joint angular displacement were computed. Torsion and lateral 
bending of the spine were also estimated. Combining kinematic and kinetic data torque and power at hip, 
shoulder and elbow joints were estimated. Finally load impulses (integral of vertical component of GRF) on feet 
and walking aids were computed. Results show bigger peak of force on arms when crutches are used, while the 
impulse on arms is bigger with frame. Joint angle ranges are quite similar in both cases, even if the pattern on 
elbow joint is different because of the linkage between the two arms when frame is used. Analysis of torque and 
power at hip joints allowed us to study the transfer of energy through the posterior reciprocator bowden cable.

show that 
the abrasive 
wear of alloys 
based on precious 
metals 
such 
as Pt, Pd, Au and Ag is higher 
than for Ti and Ti based alloys. 
The alloy 
with

Restoration of walking in paraplegic patients is a complex task. Although good results have recently 
been achieved with new ot-thoses for reciprocal gait, further improvements must be performed in terms of 
optimal adaptation to the single subject and choice of the best locomotor strategy. Attempting to face these 
problems in the present study a group of paraplegic patients walking with RGO orthosis and upper limb aids has 
been assessed with a multifactorial movement analysis system consisting on an ELITE system for kinematic 
analysis, a force platform for Ground Reaction Force (GRF) detection and a PC to store, process and graphically 
represent all data collected during movement. A couple of TV cameras were used for each side of the patient to 
allow a 3D analysis of orthosis, pelvis, upper limbs, arm aids and head. Besides a general description of walking 
pattern, the differences between the use of crutches and walking frame were investigated. General spatio- 
temporal parameter of gait and time course of joint angular displacement were computed. Torsion and lateral 
bending of the spine were also estimated. Combining kinematic and kinetic data torque and power at hip, 
shoulder and elbow joints were estimated. Finally load impulses (integral of vertical component of GRF) on feet 
and walking aids were computed. Results show bigger peak of force on arms when crutches are used, while the 
impulse on arms is bigger with frame. Joint angle ranges are quite similar in both cases, even if the pattern on 
elbow joint is different because of the linkage between the two arms when frame is used. Analysis of torque and 
power at hip joints allowed us to study the transfer of energy through the posterior reciprocator bowden cable.

The feasibility of vibration analysis as 
a technique for objective fracture monitoring was investigated. During a clinical 
pilot study, the resonant frequencies of the first single bending and rigid body tibia1 flexural vibration modes were 
measured 
(using hammer impact technique) on nine tibia1 
fracture patients on a weekly base. 
The measurements were 
made on a relaxed hanging lower leg (without cast) following a strictly protocolled procedure. The stand& 
deviation 
for the resonant frequencies obtained during one measurement session 
was significantly better for the single bending 
(2.3 %) than for the rigid body mode (5.2 %) and usually a little better for the heatthy than for the fractured leg. The 
resonant frequencies of the bealtlylegremained 
fairly constant during the healing process. 
The reproducibility of the 
single bending mode was extremely high (2.1 %) and far superior to the rigid body 
mode 
(9.9 
%). 
When 
the 
fracrured 
/eg 
was in a stage of the healing process 
where: (1) the fracture was springy, (2) the resonances 
were clear and easy 
to 
obtain and (3) the shape of the frequency response 
functions for the heaithy and the fractured leg were almost similar, 
the evolution of the single bending resonant frequencies 
were linearly correlated (r*>0.76) to the number of weeks 
post 
fracture. For the rigidbodyresonances, no such correlation was demonstrated. Possibly due to (1) lower sensitivity to 
the healing process than the single bending mode and (2) poor reproducibi4ity.

RAGGEDNESS: A BIOMECHANICAL 
MEASURE OF OSTEOARTHRITIC GAIT 
Robyn H. Grote 
School of Physiotherapy, 
Otago Polytechnic, Dunedin, New Zealand 
It has been observed clinically that osteoarthritic (OA) gait 
is 
not 
smooth. 
A concept 
“Raggedness” 
was 
developed 
to characterize the irregularities observed in the force and centre of pressure data. Data was collected from subjects 
with unilateral OA of the knee and control subjects using a Kistler force platform.‘& 
observed 
aberrations 
from m 
force-time and centre of pressure (COP) time curves were assumed to be parabolic and their areas calculated. The 
normal curves were described by Chao et al (1983) and Grate (1991). The mean areas &.d) 
were determined for each 
section of gait. The assumption that few aberrations would occur 
in the vertical components of force-time data was 
rejected for both males and females. 
A tenfold increase in aberration for the OA group was detected in the 
anteroposterior 
progression of the COP for the females. 
A large increase in raggedness was observed in the 
mediolateral force-time data in the OA females. Clearly there are different patterns of raggedness for different sections 
and within these sections sex differences also occur. In summary this work has: 
(i) defined ragged data (viz. a biomechantcal manifestation of OA gait) 
(ii) quantified the vacillation of OA gait and maybe its the reduced shock absorption capacity. 
Future work will include the development of software to determine raggedness; and the manipulation 
of this with 
other biomechanical descriptors developed by Grote (1991) into a performance index. This will be used to test common 
therapies available for OA of the knee, with a view to optimizing therapy to normalise the OA knee.

In this study we present 
the mechanical 
performance 
of “Dynamic”, a new external fixator .The 
“Dynamic” external 
fixator is an 
unilateral device 
with a titanium central 
rod. The rod is half-threaded 
and 
half with a particular 
dynamization 
system. 
A range 
of three 
different interchangeable 
silicone 
rings 
with different progressive 
stiffness 
provides 
a springy progressive 
dynamization. 
Each 
outer end has 
a 
pin bracket 
with three 
freedom 
degrees 
with a double locking cone 
with allows a 360 degrees 
rotation 
on two orthogonal 
planesThe stiffness 
and 
the underload 
stability of the pin clamp in our device 
were 
compared 
with the same 
performances 
of usual 
external 
fixators. Furthermore 
mechanical 
(static and 
dynamic) tests were carried 
out on the apparatus 
of dynamization.The test results performed on 
“Dynamic” external 
fmator give prominence 
to high stiffness 
and 
to excellent 
stability of our system. 
The 
locking system 
of the 
pm fixation bracket 
has 
a very good 
stability with fairly little locking strength. 
The 
three 
freedom degrees 
of our clamps 
permit a large movement 
range: 
360 degrees 
on two orthogonal 
planes 
and translation along fixator axis. These 
characteristics 
allow to use 
the “Dynamic” fixator in 
many surgical situations. Finally the dynamization system 
permits an elastic synthesis 
with constant 
springy answer 
of silicone rings.

It has 
been suggested 
that the frictional torque generated 
between 
the articulating surfaces 
of Charnley 
total hip replacement 
is one of the factors leading 
to the early loosening 
of the acetabular 
component. The 
friction in explanted 
and 
new Charnley 
prostheses 
has 
been 
measured 
using 
the Durham hip function simulator 
which modelled 
a walking cycle with loads 
up to 2000 N. The friction factors were determined 
under both 
dry and 
lubricated 
conditions. Initial results, 
in the form of a Stribeck 
plot, indicate 
a mixed 
lubrication regime 
for all 
joints measured. 
For a given Sommetfeld 
number, 
the explanted 
prostheses 
showed 
a wide variation in 
friction factor, from 0.05 up to 0.26 for a fluid with viscosity of 10 mPa s. The new prostheses 
however 
showed 
an average 
friction factor value of 0.05 for a similar fluid environment. Results 
of the friction factor 
showed 
no correlation with implant period, wear depth 
or radius 
of curvature 
of the acetabular surface in the 
area 
of contact for dry and lubricated 
joints. However, a weak correlation was found between 
penetration 
depth and friction factor for lubricated conditions (PcO.1) indicating that the wear process enhances 
the 
lubrication 
mechanism.

RAGGEDNESS: A BIOMECHANICAL

It has been observed clinically that osteoarthritic (OA) gait 
is 
not 
smooth. 
A concept 
“Raggedness” 
was 
developed 
to characterize the irregularities observed in the force and centre of pressure data. Data was collected from subjects 
with unilateral OA of the knee and control subjects using a Kistler force platform.‘& 
observed 
aberrations 
from m 
force-time and centre of pressure (COP) time curves were assumed to be parabolic and their areas calculated. The 
normal curves were described by Chao et al (1983) and Grate (1991). The mean areas &.d) 
were determined for each 
section of gait. The assumption that few aberrations would occur 
in the vertical components of force-time data was 
rejected for both males and females. 
A tenfold increase in aberration for the OA group was detected in the 
anteroposterior 
progression of the COP for the females. 
A large increase in raggedness was observed in the 
mediolateral force-time data in the OA females. Clearly there are different patterns of raggedness for different sections 
and within these sections sex differences also occur. In summary this work has: 
(i) defined ragged data (viz. a biomechantcal manifestation of OA gait) 
(ii) quantified the vacillation of OA gait and maybe its the reduced shock absorption capacity. 
Future work will include the development of software to determine raggedness; and the manipulation 
of this with 
other biomechanical descriptors developed by Grote (1991) into a performance index. This will be used to test common 
therapies available for OA of the knee, with a view to optimizing therapy to normalise the OA knee.

Isokinetic evaluation

is a widespread 
method 
to assess 
musle 
function. However, in a clinical context of rehabilitation medicine, the outcome 
cannot 
be 
related 
to the disability of the patient at the functional level. Using biomechanical 
analyses 
of functional ablities like walking, negotiating stairs and rising from a chair, descriptions 
of joint functions can be achieved 
in terms of joint motion and net 
joint moments. 
This 
was elaborated 
for the knee. From these 
analyses 
it is clear that isokinetic conditions do 
not match 
these 
joint-function descriptions, 
so it lacks a more specific insight in the 
function of the joint. Ability-specific measurements 
are necessary 
to assess 
the role of an 
impaired 
joint function in relation to the overall goal of the therapy. A prediction of 
assessments 
at the level of joint function, towards the functional level is always complica- 
ted. This problem is not easily solved, but the biomechanical 
analyses, 
as shown, serve 
as 
a rationale for the interpretation of joint-function asessments.

A SIMPLE METHOD 
FOR EVALUATING 
EFFORT DURING GAIT IN BELOW-KNEE-AMPUTEE

An important issue in the developnent of new prosthetic 
components for below-knee- 
amputee (BKA) children 
is the energy cost or effort 
associated with the new cmponents. 
However, measuring oxygen uptake requires special equipment , substantial 
time, and trained 
personnel not typically 
found in a biomechanics laboratory. 
The purpose of this 
investigation 
was to determine the relationships 
among 
simple methods for measuring effort 
and oxygen uptake in BKA 
and AB children. 
Ten BKA 
children 
(mean age, 12 years) and 13 
able-bodied 
(AB) children 
Wean age, 11 years) 
walked on a trea&nill 
and selected a freely 
chosen walking speed (CWS). Children then walked for 2 minutes at each of three speeds: 
a.?., 20% 
above CWS, 
and 20% 
below CWS. Oxygen uptake, physiological 
cost index, % 
maximum 
heart rate, and vertical 
displacement of a surface 
marker on the sacrum were determined 
for 
each subject and speed. Linear regression controlling 
for 
speed and subject 
type was used 
to determine 
correlations 
between oxygen uptake and the four variables 
(p<0.05). 
To 
evaluate 
the effectiveness 
of the regression 
equations 
two male AB children 
not part 
of the 
?B group were tested. 
The proportion 
of explained variance 
arising 
from the significant 
correlations 
between oxygen uptake and the four 
measured 
variables 
were all 
between 0.91 and 
0.92. 
It was concluded 
that 
vertical 
displacement 
of a marker on the sacrum was the 
simplest 
and most convenient 
measure for a biomechanics 
gait 
laboratory 
since only standard 
biomechanics 
laboratory 
equipment 
was required. 
However, if 
convenient 
(e.g., 
in a clinical 
setting 
where equipment was available) 
the other 
measures 
were also adequate.

This 
paper 
primarily 
deals 
with 
the changes 
of the biomechanical 
properties 
of knee joint 
tendons 
and ligaments 
through 
a wide variety 
of treatment 
modalities, 
including 
stress 
deprivation 
incurred 
by 
immobilization 
and stress 
shielding, 
recovery 
after 
stress 
deprivation 
by remobilization 
and restressing 
after 
stress 
shielding, 
and stress 
enhancement 
by exercise, 
training, 
and increased 
tension. 
The 
experimental 
results 
indicate 
that 
tendons 
and ligaments 
have the 
ability 
to adapt 
in response 
to the change of stress 
and motion 
if 
the 
extent 
of the stress 
alteration 
is within 
allowable

An important issue in the developnent of new prosthetic 
components for below-knee- 
amputee (BKA) children 
is the energy cost or effort 
associated with the new cmponents. 
However, measuring oxygen uptake requires special equipment , substantial 
time, and trained 
personnel not typically 
found in a biomechanics laboratory. 
The purpose of this 
investigation 
was to determine the relationships 
among 
simple methods for measuring effort 
and oxygen uptake in BKA 
and AB children. 
Ten BKA 
children 
(mean age, 12 years) and 13 
able-bodied 
(AB) children 
Wean age, 11 years) 
walked on a trea&nill 
and selected a freely 
chosen walking speed (CWS). Children then walked for 2 minutes at each of three speeds: 
a.?., 20% 
above CWS, 
and 20% 
below CWS. Oxygen uptake, physiological 
cost index, % 
maximum 
heart rate, and vertical 
displacement of a surface 
marker on the sacrum were determined 
for 
each subject and speed. Linear regression controlling 
for 
speed and subject 
type was used 
to determine 
correlations 
between oxygen uptake and the four variables 
(p<0.05). 
To 
evaluate 
the effectiveness 
of the regression 
equations 
two male AB children 
not part 
of the 
?B group were tested. 
The proportion 
of explained variance 
arising 
from the significant 
correlations 
between oxygen uptake and the four 
measured 
variables 
were all 
between 0.91 and 
0.92. 
It was concluded 
that 
vertical 
displacement 
of a marker on the sacrum was the 
simplest 
and most convenient 
measure for a biomechanics 
gait 
laboratory 
since only standard 
biomechanics 
laboratory 
equipment 
was required. 
However, if 
convenient 
(e.g., 
in a clinical 
setting 
where equipment was available) 
the other 
measures 
were also adequate.
